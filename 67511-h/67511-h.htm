ALICE and Beatrice were two little
girls of about four and six years
of age. They were staying with
their grandmamma. Alice and Beatrice were
very glad to be with their grandmamma, for
she lived in the country and near the sea. They
liked to see the green fields, full of pretty
flowers, and to play in the nice large garden,
and to walk up and down the high hills that
were on all sides of the house, and also they
liked to go to the sea-shore and look on the
wide sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma loved Alice and Beatrice very
much, and she liked to have them with her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and she tried to make them good and happy.
Every morning they said their prayers to her,
and every evening before they went to bed;
and they never forgot to thank God, who had
taken care of them during the night, and to beg
God to bless and take care of them, and all
those they loved, that day and always. Little
Beatrice could not say her prayers quite so
well as Alice, but she said them better and
better every day.</p>

<p class='c014'>After breakfast grandmamma had to order
the dinner, and whilst she went to the kitchen
to speak to the cook, she let the two little girls
run up and down the long verandah which was
in front of the house, and which led to the
pretty garden.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice read to her grandmamma, learned by
heart and said some verses from her hymnbook,
and little Beatrice always learned one
verse every day. Then Alice did some sums,
and after she had shown them, and grandmamma
had found them all right, Alice wrote
her copy. As soon as Alice began to write,
Beatrice brought her letters and tried to learn
to know them. Grandmamma told her when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>she knew them all she would give her a book
with large letters and words.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the lessons were over, the little girls
went out for a walk with Mary.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mary was a kind person and very fond of the
two children, and they liked Mary very much.
Mary went with Alice and Beatrice down the
sloping walks, till they came to a gate, which
they opened; they then went across a little
wooden bridge, and down a very steep path and
some steps that led to the sea-shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice liked to go to the sea-shore
very much. Mary sat on the sand and
worked, whilst Alice and Beatrice played about.
They had each of them a pretty wooden basket
and a little wooden spade, and they dug in the
sand on the sea-shore, and filled their baskets
with sand or stones. Sometimes they dug
large holes for the sea to come in, and they
liked to see the waves come higher and higher,
till the large holes were full of water. Sometimes
Alice and Beatrice dug a long ditch down
the sloping shore to the edge of the waves, and
the water ran down it into the sea, and they
called it their river. When they were tired of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>digging, they asked Mary if they might look for
pretty stones, and shells, and sea-weed.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were plenty of pretty stones and sea-weed,
and even shells, to be found. Some of
the shells were pretty and white and smooth,
and the children took great care of them, and
took them home to play with. They often
found sea-weeds of all colours, red and yellow,
green and brown, and some sea-weeds were
small and fine, like hair or moss; and grandmamma
helped them to dry them, and put them
on paper. There was another kind of sea-weed
that was very long and heavy, and looked
like large black rushes. Mary told them not
to take those home, for they were not nice, and
they could not be dried.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day Alice found a pretty stone, or pebble,
as it is called: it was very clear, not quite so
clear as glass; but when she held it towards
the sun, she could see through it.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I will take the pretty stone home, Mary,’
said Alice, ‘and give it dear mamma.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Perhaps,’ said Mary, ‘your mamma will
have it cut and polished for a brooch.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, I am sure she will,’ cried Alice; ‘I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>so glad that I have found it!’ and Alice put it
into her pocket.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I will try and find a pretty stone too for
mamma,’ said Beatrice, and she ran along the
sand, close to the waves: and just when Mary
called her to come away, a large wave came
higher up than the others had done before,
and wetted little Beatrice’s shoes and socks.</p>

<p class='c014'>Beatrice ran back to Mary, and she was a
little frightened, and she said, ‘Mary, I did not
hear you call me till that big wave came up to
my feet, and I could not run away quick enough,
and my feet are so wet.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘We must go home directly, Miss Beatrice,’
said Mary, ‘and make haste and change your
shoes and socks;’ and they went home.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another day they went to the beach again,
and their grandmamma went with them. As
they went through the pretty garden, they
stopped to look at the rose-trees that were
beginning to bloom; and grandmamma gave
Alice a white rose and Beatrice a dark-red one.
She cut off the thorns from the stalks, and
Beatrice asked her, ‘Why do you cut off those
things, grandmamma?’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>‘Those things are called thorns, my dear child;
they would prick your fingers, for they are very
sharp.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The children looked at the thorns, and put
their fingers to them, and said, ‘They prick
like needles.’ They thanked her for the roses,
and smelt them, for they were very sweet.</p>

<p class='c014'>They went on to the gate, and then grandmamma
opened it, and gave Beatrice her hand
across the narrow bridge, and down the steep
path, and the many steps.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice ran on alone, jumping along, and pulling
some wild flowers that grew in the grass on
each side the path, and she came first to the
beach, and then ran back to meet her grandmamma
and little sister.</p>

<p class='c014'>When they came to the sea-shore, they saw
that Mary was there waiting for them with a
large basket. They knew that the basket was
full of their bathing dresses; for their grandmamma
liked them to bathe in the sea whenever
the weather was warm and the sun shone.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a tent at the foot of the cliff, for
a steep cliff rose very high a little way from the
sea-shore on each side of the narrow valley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>through which they had to come. In this tent
the two little girls went to undress and get
ready for bathing. Mary helped them; and
when they had put on their bathing dresses,
Mary did the same, and went into the sea with
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice ran into the water alone, and jumped
over the little waves that came rolling gently
on to the shore. Beatrice took hold of Mary’s
hand, but she was not afraid, and she dipped
her face and hands into the waves, and she
tried to jump about like Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Beatrice asked Mary to let her float;
and Mary held Beatrice’s head, and the little
girl lay quite stiff and quiet on the water, and her
feet and body floated, which she liked very much.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Please, Mary,’ said Alice, ‘let me try and
float too.’ And Mary let Beatrice stand by her
side and floated Alice backwards and forwards.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘When I am a little older,’ said Alice, ‘grandmamma
says that I must learn to swim.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘And I, too,’ said Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the children had jumped about a short
time in the waves, and were quite warm, their
grandmamma said—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>‘Come out now, you have been in the water
long enough;’ and the little girls came out and
ran into the tent, where they were soon dried
and dressed, for their grandmamma helped them
too, and they made haste to go home, up the
many steps and steep path, and were glad to
have their dinner, because they were hungry
after their bath.</p>

THE weather had been very hot—so
hot that the children had had no
walk, but had spent most of the
day in the shade under the long verandah,
and in the afternoon they had played under a
large tree in the garden. When the evening
came it was much cooler; and after the little
girls had had their tea, grandmamma told them
that she would take them over the high hill at
the back of the house to visit a poor woman
who had been ill. Their grandmamma’s house
was half-way up the hill—you could see the
sea through a narrow valley; and opposite the
house on the other side of the valley was another
high hill, and behind that hill was the town.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Grandmamma walked slowly up the hill, up
a zig-zag path, and rested on a bench half-way
up, for it was a very steep hill. The little girls
were not tired, and they ran on before and
waited for their grandmamma at each turn of
the path. They went higher and higher, till at
last Alice called out—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How much I can see now, grandmamma!
I can see all the town, the houses, and the
church!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I can see two churches,’ said Beatrice;
‘and what a lot of ships!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Please, grandmamma,’ said Alice, ‘come up
higher. Pray, dear grandmamma, make haste,
there is a great smoke on the sea; it comes
from a ship. Is the ship on fire?’ she asked a
little anxiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>Their grandmamma was soon by the children’s
side.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘That is a steamer or steamship, dear Alice;
it has a fire in it that causes the smoke, but it
is not on fire, and you can see that the smoke
comes out of a tall black chimney. You have
seen the train come and go often, and you know
how much smoke it makes.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>‘Yes, I know; but the smoke from the train
is not black like that, and why is that?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You are right, dear child, it is not black;
but that is because they burn a different kind of
coal, called coke, in trains. Trains and steamers
are made to move by the same means, which is
by steam. Some clever man made steam turn
wheels and raise heavy beams up and down,
and thus it is that ships and trains are made
to move. Steam is made to grind corn, and to
make biscuits, and to saw wood, and steam
helps to make nearly everything we wear.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Oh! grandmamma, how wonderful! I do
not understand how steam can do all that. The
man must have been very clever to have thought
of this. Do you know his name?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘James Watt was his name; he made the
first good and useful steam-engine, I believe,
about seventy years ago; but he was not the
first man who had found out that steam
could be made useful, or who made the first
engine.’</p>

<p class='c014'>When they came to the top of the hill they
saw several cows feeding on the grass.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Will these cows hurt us?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>‘No, my dear, they will not, unless you tease
them.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But why do people run away when they see
cows?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is very foolish of any one to run away.
When a poor cow or ox has been treated ill by
naughty boys or cruel men, and frightened and
made angry, it runs about; sometimes people
have been tossed and hurt. But if you will
treat a cow kindly, I am sure that it will never
hurt you.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The little girls walked through the green
meadow when the cows were feeding, and the
cows did them no harm. They soon came to a
nice little cottage, with a few trees close by, and
a little garden.</p>

<p class='c014'>Their grandmamma spoke to an old woman
who was sitting outside the cottage door, and
said to her that she was glad to see her up and
looking better; and the old woman replied that
the warm weather had done her a great deal of
good, and that she was very glad to see her and
the little children.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whilst their grandmamma was talking to the
old woman, Alice and Beatrice looked about them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and examined with wonder a cushion that the old
woman had had on her lap when they came.</p>

<p class='c014'>They then played with a little kitten that
was in the garden till their grandmamma had
finished talking. Then Alice asked, ‘What is
this cushion for, with all those little sticks
hanging down on each side of it, and what was
the old woman doing with them?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Mrs. Miller is making lace, dear Alice, and
these sticks are called bobbins, and there is
some very fine thread which she braids and
twists together into a pretty pattern.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The kind old woman came and took her
cushion, and sitting down, began to show Alice
and Beatrice how she twisted the little bobbins
backwards and forwards, and threw them from
one side the cushion to the other. She did this
at first very slowly, that the little girls might
see it more easily; but when they had looked
enough, she threw her bobbins backwards and
forwards so quickly that the children were quite
surprised. Mrs. Miller then told them that all
the little girls in the village begin to learn to
make lace when they are seven or eight years
old, and learn soon to make it nicely.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>‘How very pretty it is!’ said Alice. ‘I
should like to learn to make lace. May I,
grandmamma, when I am older?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, you may, if you wish it; but you must
first learn to sew neatly, for that is more useful
than making lace.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But why do all the little girls here learn to
make lace, grandmamma?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Because they can help to earn money for
their father and mother. Among the poor
people in the village, very young children begin
to help to earn their own bread.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Before the little girls went home, they ran
about on the green meadow, and gathered a
handful of yellow cowslips and other wild flowers;
but when the sun went behind the opposite hill,
and the clouds above the sun were red and
bright like gold, and the sea looked nearly the
same colour as the clouds, grandmamma said—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘We will go back now, for it is time for my
little girls to go to bed.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Then they all returned down the zig-zag path,
and were soon home again, and Alice and
Beatrice went to bed, after telling Mary first of
all that they had seen.</p>

‘WHAT a rainy day!’ said Alice, one
morning, when Mary came to call
them, and to help them to dress.
‘We cannot go out at all to-day.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What a pity!’ said her little sister. ‘I am
so sorry.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What shall we do all day, if we cannot go
out?’ said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The rain will make all your flowers grow,
miss,’ said Mary, ‘and make the weather a little
cooler.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But I want to go out and dig in the sand,’
said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘And so do I,’ said Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Mary took no further notice of the children’s
words; but when they were at breakfast, Alice
said, ‘Grandmamma, is it not very tiresome
that the rain is come to-day? We cannot go
out. I wish that it would never rain.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Nasty rain,’ said Beatrice; ‘I can’t bear the
rain!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You must not say that the rain is nasty, for
it does a great deal of good, dear children. God
sends us the rain when we want it, and we thank
God for it.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Why do you thank God, grandmamma,’
asked Alice, ‘for the rain? What good can the
rain do?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It makes the grass grow; and horses, cows,
and sheep, and all other animals that eat grass,
live upon it; and the rain makes the corn grow,
and from corn we make our bread; and what
would you or I do, or any one else, if the corn
did not grow and we had no bread? The rain
makes the trees and the flowers grow, and all
the fruit too, and my little girls would be sorry
if there were no fruit.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, indeed, grandmamma,’ cried both
children.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>‘But I thought,’ said Alice, ‘that the sun made
the fruit ripe.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, so it does; but the sun alone could not
make the plants grow, and the rain alone could
not make the flowers open their leaves, or the
fruit or the corn get ripe. We want both sun
and rain, and we must thank God that He
gives us enough of each to do good on earth.’</p>

<p class='c014'>After the two little girls had finished their
little lessons, and done all that their grandmamma
wished them to do, she said to them—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘As you have both been good this morning,
and because it rains, I will tell you a story of
my two dogs, when I lived in Russia.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It was a hot summer’s day, a long time ago,
when my little dog Pretty came to me yelling
and barking. I was busy writing in a little
sitting-room that opened into my bedroom, and
my rooms in Russia were all downstairs, as there
was but one floor.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘When I looked at Pretty, I saw that the dog
was trembling all over, and every hair was
standing up, for he was so frightened; and he
whined and ran about, and howled and barked
in great distress; and at last he ran into my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>bedroom, and crept under the bed, and there he
lay trembling and whining.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘All the doors stand open in a house in
Russia; so I went into the hall and then out of
the open front door, and I soon saw what was
the cause of Pretty’s fear. There was a great
brown bear; and though little Pretty had never
seen a bear before, yet his terror was so great.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The bear had a leathern strap round his
mouth, a small iron chain was fixed to the
strap; and when I looked nearer, I saw that a
hole had been made in the bear’s upper lip,
and a ring was put through the hole, and the
chain was fastened to the ring as well as to the
leathern strap.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘A Russian peasant was with the bear, and he
wore blue striped linen trousers, and his trousers
were tucked into his boots, but he had neither
stockings nor socks. He had a red and white
checked shirt, which hung loose over his
trousers, and funny pieces of blue linen sewed
into the sleeves of his shirt. He had a fur cap
on his head, and in his hand he carried a long
stout pole.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The Russian peasant called to the bear to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>up, for the bear seemed tired, and had laid down
to rest himself. The bear growled, but did not
move at first, though his master shook the chain
and pulled him by it; at last the man gave him
a sharp blow with a whip he had, and told him
to begin dancing.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The poor tired bear stood up on his hind
legs, and took the pole from the man’s hand, and
began to jump over it, but in a very clumsy
manner. The man kept calling to him in a
sing-song manner, pulling often with the chain,
and giving him a smart cut with his whip: and
the bear jumped backwards and forwards over
the pole, or, as the man called it, <i>danced</i>, and
grumbled and growled, for he seemed very
cross and angry that he was obliged to do all
this when he was so very hot and tired. I
looked about to see where my good old dog Lion
was all this time. Lion was a splendid dog,
something like an English mastiff, and something
like a lioness, and therefore I had named
him “Lion.” He went out daily with the herd
of cattle into the fields and woods, and saved
many of them from being killed by the wolves.
He was a brave dog, and I was very fond of him.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>‘And where do you think I found Lion now?—not
running away and hiding himself, like
Pretty, in “the lady’s chamber,” but trying to
make the bear afraid of him.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘For Lion walked slowly up close to the bear,
then went round him twice, looking at him well
all the time, as if to say, “I am not in the least
afraid of you, Mr. Bear,” and then Lion lay
down on the grass in the shade, a little way off,
but so that he should see him still, and went
to sleep, or pretended to do so. I dare say that
the bear thought he had better not go near such
a brave dog, though he would have liked to give
Lion a good hug, and eat him up.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘At last the Russian peasant seemed as hot
and as tired as the bear, and he asked for something
to eat, and some spirits to drink. So I
told a servant to bring the man some black
bread and some beer and a little spirits, and I
ordered some honey and some bread for the
bear.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Why did you give the poor man <i>black</i> bread,
grandmamma?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘In Russia, the servants and common people
all eat black bread; the white bread which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>eat here is only made for the rich people to
eat!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But why is that, grandmamma?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is because wheat, of which our white
bread is made, does not grow nearly so well as
rye in Russia and other cold countries: and rye
makes black bread. It is not so good as wheat
bread; but some people like it, and even prefer
it.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Please, Alice, let grandmamma tell us the
story of Lion and the Bear,’ said Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Well, my dear children, you would have
been glad to see how the bear liked the bread
dipped in honey, and how he drank the spirits
and the beer; but the man did not give him
much of either. Afterwards I gave the man
some money, and the poor tired bear walked
after his master, as well as he could, on his four
feet. As soon as the bear was gone, out came
Pretty from my bedroom, and began to bark
very furiously, as if he had been a brave dog,
and driven the bear away.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Thank you, dear grandmamma,’ said both
the little girls. ‘We like that story so much,
pray tell us some more about your brave dog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Lion, and about silly little Pretty, another
day.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But Pretty was not always silly, although
he was afraid of a big bear. He was a knowing
little dog, and so fond of us.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I should have been afraid, I think,’ said
Alice. ‘I should not like a bear to come to
this house.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘There are no bears here, are there, grandmamma?’
asked little Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘And no horrid wolves?’ added Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, dear children, none, I am glad to say.
When you read more in your history of England,
you will read when the last wolves were
killed in England: a very long time ago there
used to be plenty of wolves here.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The two little girls looked afraid; but they
were very glad when grandmamma said—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘That was a very, very long time ago.’</p>

‘NOW, Alice, bring your atlas, and I
will show you on the map where
Russia lies.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice brought her book of maps, and soon
found the maps of Europe and Asia; and
grandmamma showed her where the large
country lay, and pointed out to her that the
greatest part of Russia was in Asia, and reached
across the whole of northern Asia.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Oh, how big it is!’ cried Alice; ‘it is much
bigger than all the other countries together.
Look at little England, Beatrice,—this little
island is England, where we live; does it not
look tiny? And now look at big Russia. Look,
all that yellow is Russia!’ and Alice put her
finger on the line that divided Russia from all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the other countries, and showed her little sister
how large it was.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Do you see, Alice,’ said grandmamma, ‘how
far Russia extends? Even that smaller part
that is in Europe reaches up to the Arctic or
Frozen Ocean, and down to the Black Sea on
the south; do you see, Alice?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Why is that sea called the Frozen Ocean?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Because it is frozen for many months in the
year, and the greater part of it is always
frozen.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Can the sea really freeze, grandmamma?’
asked both the little girls. ‘How can the
waves freeze, and be made quiet?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The sea that lies on the north of Russia
freezes every winter, but our sea here does not
freeze; it is too warm.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But how can it freeze, grandmamma? I
cannot understand how it can,’ said the little
girl.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is difficult to make it clear to you, Alice;
but I will try and explain it. First, from the
great cold, little pieces of ice are formed; these
pieces float about, for ice is lighter than water,
and are tossed up and down by the restless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>waves; and they grow in size, and become
bigger and bigger, till some join and stick together,
and go on getting larger, till by degrees
they cover the surface of the water. These
pieces or masses of ice are pushed towards the
shore, and there the ice first begins to make a
firm covering over the sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But the ice on the sea is never smooth or
even, like the ice on a pond or on a river; it is
rough, and large pieces are heaped together,
and large cracks are often made in the ice by the
wind and the waves moving it, which makes it
dangerous to drive or even walk a long distance
over the Frozen Sea.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Can people drive over the sea? But if it is
frozen hard, why is it dangerous?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, dear Alice, people can and do drive on
the Frozen Sea, and I have driven short
distances myself on it, and I have known
many people cross this gulf,’ showing Alice the
Gulf of Finland. ‘You know, dear, what a
gulf is?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes,’ said Alice; ‘it is an arm of the sea
that runs into the land.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The peasants, or poor country people, used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>to drive across this gulf, as soon as the ice was
tolerably firm and safe. They drove in small
sledges drawn by little horses, and took over
corn and other things to sell to the inhabitants
of rocky Finland, where very little corn grows.
But the getting across the large crevices or
cracks was both difficult and dangerous. The
people for that purpose take long boards with
them on their sledges, and laying them across
these open places, they drag their sledges over,
walking over the planks themselves, and making
their horses swim through the water; but
their horses have often been lost in these large
cracks, for though the horses can always swim,
they cannot always get out of them, as the ice
at the edges is brittle, and breaks under their
efforts to scramble up.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I remember how some men, belonging to one
of our villages, were lost in a snow-storm out at
sea, and their bodies were not found till the
summer, on a small, uninhabited island where
they had taken refuge during the storm, lying
on their faces. I believe that they had first lost
their horses.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How did they die, poor men? Were they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>starved or frozen to death on that desert
island?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I believe that they were frozen to death, and
had gone to sleep from the cold, and never
awoke.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How very sad!’ said both the little girls.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But did you like Russia, grandmamma,’
asked Alice; ‘so cold and horrible, with wolves
and bears?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The winter in Russia is very long, and
where I lived it sometimes lasted half the year,
and we saw no grass all that time.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How did you like to live in Russia, then?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I had kind friends there; but though I liked
some people very much, I did not like the
country or the climate. In truth, dear children,
there is no country in the whole world like our
dear England; no country where people love
God and pray to God so much as in England;
and no country where everybody tries to do so
much good as in England.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Now, Alice, look for the two great capital
cities of Russia. The old capital is called
Moscow, and the new one is called St. Petersburg.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Alice looked carefully at her map, and when
grandmamma had told her that St. Petersburg
lies high up in the north and Moscow much
lower to the east, Alice found both places.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Please show me, grandmamma, where you
lived.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Here,’ said grandmamma, ‘on the shores of
the Gulf of Finland, where the sea freezes in
winter.’</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE next morning it rained again, and
the little girls could not go out; but
they were not unhappy, because they
knew that grandmamma would tell them some
stories, or give them something to amuse them.</p>

<p class='c014'>After their lessons, grandmamma said, ‘Alice
and Beatrice, I am going down into the cellar,
will you come with me?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, please, please,’ cried both the little
girls; ‘we shall like to come with you so much;
we have never seen the cellar.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Is it quite dark, grandmamma?’ asked
Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, to be sure,’ said Alice; ‘but Mary has
a candle, and will show us light.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Mary walked on in front, and went slowly
down a long, dark, narrow staircase. Alice ran
after her, and Beatrice, holding grandmamma’s
hand, followed carefully.</p>

<p class='c014'>The little girls looked about in wonder; they
did not know what a large place the cellar was.
There were several rooms, all called cellars,
which Mary showed them. First, to the right
hand, without a door, was a very large and
black-looking place, and when Mary lighted it
up, the children saw that it was full of coals.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘That is our coal cellar, miss,’ said Mary;
‘and this,’ opening a door, ‘is for the beer and
cider.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The children looked in, and saw several tubs
of beer and cider placed side by side. Then
grandmamma unlocked another door, and that
was the wine cellar. They all went in; it was
much cleaner and drier than the other cellars,
and all the bottles were arranged neatly: and
just when the children were going to ask some
questions, grandmamma remembered that Mary
had forgotten to bring down a bottle of wine to
exchange for another bottle; so Mary went
back with the candle, and Alice and Beatrice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>were left in the dark cellar with their grandmamma.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first the two children were quite silent, till
Beatrice, who held grandmamma’s hand, said,
‘Grandmamma, can God see us everywhere?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, Beatrice; everywhere and always.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Can God see us in this dark cellar?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, dear children. God sees in the dark
as in the light; by night and by day: God sees
everybody and everything. In the Psalms<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
you will read, “He who planted the ear, shall
he not hear? or he who made the eye, shall
he not see?” which means that God who
made our ears must be able to hear everything,
and God who made our eyes surely can see
everything.’</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c016'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Psa. xciv. 9.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Little Beatrice thought a little while, and
then she said, ‘But God cannot tell mamma
when I am naughty, can He?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, my dear little girl; but you must fear
God more than you fear mamma. You can
never be naughty without God’s knowing it;
and are you not afraid of God’s being angry
with you?’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>‘Mamma says that God is very good and
very great,’ said Alice, ‘and that He takes care
of us always, and of the whole world; and
will God be angry with such a little girl as
Beatrice?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘If Beatrice did not know that it was wrong
to be naughty, God would not be angry with
her; but Beatrice knows quite well when she
is good and when she is naughty.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Little Beatrice pressed grandmamma’s hand,
and as grandmamma thought she heard her
sob, she took her up in her arms, and Beatrice
whispered, as soon as her tears let her, that
she would try and be very good.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You must think more about being good, both
of you, when you say your prayers, and when you
ask God to help you to be good children.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Mary now came back with the candle, and
grandmamma soon finished all that she wished
to do, and then they all went upstairs again;
and it seemed so light and bright when they
were upstairs, that they could scarcely see, and
the sun was shining, and the rain had ceased.
The black clouds had gone away far over the
hills, and the blue sky was there again.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Alice and Beatrice clapped their hands, and
were like the sunshine, gay and bright; all
their black clouds had gone away too. They
put on their hats and jackets to run down the
steep path to the sea for their usual bath; but
before they went, grandmamma told them to be
careful, for it would be very slippery after the
rain.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice walked slowly down to
the sea-shore with Mary. When they crossed
the wooden bridge they were surprised to see
how much water was in the little brook. They
stopped to look at it, for it was very pretty:
there was quite a waterfall just above the
bridge, and the water splashed and made a loud
noise in falling. The grass looked more green,
and the flowers smelt more sweet, and Alice
said, ‘Mary, I think that grandmamma is quite
right: the rain does a great deal of good. The
grass looks much greener, and the flowers look
much prettier, and the little brook does not
murmur now, but it rushes and roars like the
river Sid by the mill. I know some pretty
verses about “How welcome is the rain!” but
I never thought before how nice the rain was.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>‘When it is over, Alice; but not while it
rains and you cannot go out,’ said Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But grandmamma tells us nice stories, or
shows us something. I do not think that I
mind the rain now,’ said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Oh! Mary, what is that over the sea?’ cried
Alice. ‘How beautiful it is! Look, Beatrice,
blue and red and yellow—I cannot count the
colours.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is a rainbow, Miss Alice,’ said Mary.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But what is a rainbow, and how does it
come there?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You must ask your grandmamma when
you go home. I only know that it comes when
the rain is over.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The sea had been very rough early in the
morning. A sailor told the children that it was
then much too rough for them to bathe; but
the rain had come and made the sea smoother,
and Alice said, ‘The rain has done good again.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The waves, or breakers, as they are called,
when they came up on the shore, were still too
rough for the little girls to move about alone
in the water, so Mary let them sit near the
edge and held them firmly; and the white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>waves dashed over their heads and the froth
covered them, and they liked it very much.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fishermen pushing their Boat off to Sea.—<i>Page <a href='#Page_43'>43</a>.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>They saw two fishermen afterwards putting
a boat into the sea, and they begged Mary to
let them stay and see it go off. Several times
the men pushed the boat off the shore, and each
time a big wave came and lifted it up and threw
it back again. Then two other men came to
help them, and pushed the boat with great force
from the shore far into the water; and the boat
rocked up and down so much among the great
waves, that the two children were frightened,
and Alice began to cry. But Mary told them
not to be afraid, for the men were quite safe, as
the sea was much smoother as soon as the boat
had passed the breakers and was farther off the
shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>When Alice and Beatrice were at home they
told grandmamma all that they had seen, and
how high the waves were, and that there was so
much white froth on the shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Alice asked grandmamma to tell them
about the rainbow that they had seen. ‘It was
so beautiful, grandmamma!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I cannot explain to you the reason why the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>rainbow appears, but I know that it is caused or
made by the sun being <i>reflected</i> on the moist air.
You know, Alice, what “reflected” means; it
is as when the light of the candle is seen again,
or reflected in the looking-glass: and the sun
shining on the moist air reflects those bright
colours on a cloud. When you are older you
will learn all about it, and why it is always in
the shape of an arch or bow. Every one loves
to see a rainbow, because it reminds us of the
promise God made to Noah, and all people,
after the flood, that He would no more destroy
all flesh, which means, every living creature.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I remember all about it, grandmamma,’ said
Alice; ‘I have read it in my Bible stories. May
I read it to Beatrice?’ and Alice fetched her
book and read about the flood and the rainbow to
Beatrice; and afterwards grandmamma read to
them from the Bible as follows (Gen. ix. 13-15):
‘I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for
a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud
over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the
cloud: and I will remember my covenant between
me and you and every living creature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>all flesh: and the waters shall no more become
a flood to destroy all flesh.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘So you see, dear children, that God has made
a covenant, which means an agreement or promise,
never to destroy the earth again by a flood,
and the rainbow is a sign of His promise, and
reminds us of it.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I am very glad to know about the rainbow,
and I will think of God’s promise when I see
one again.’</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi0_7'>
IT was just after the children’s dinner,
one very hot day towards the end of
May, that the gardener came to the
verandah where the two little girls were sitting
with their grandmamma, and said—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Please, ma’am, the bees are swarming.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Swarming, grandmamma,’ said Alice and
Beatrice, ‘what is that? May we come and
see?’</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma gave leave, and they ran and
put on their hats and followed their grandmamma
into the garden, to that part where the bee-house
was. When they came there, the gardener
showed them a large black lump, that looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>like a great bag, hanging from a rose-tree, and
the rose-tree was bent down by the weight of
it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma explained to the children that
the black lump or mass was all bees; that there
had been too many bees in the hive, so that
there was not room enough for all of them to
work, and that the hive was too hot in this very
hot weather, and the queen bee wished to seek
another home for herself, and had flown out
accompanied by the older bees, leaving all the
young ones and a young queen in the old hive
with its store of honey.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the queen bee had settled on this rose-tree,
all the other bees that were flying about
in the air had come to her, and collected round
her, hanging one over another. Grandmamma
told the children, too, that every bee had provided
itself with a quantity of honey, in case
they should not find a shelter that night, and
were not able to provide themselves with food
the next day; each bee carried a little bag of
honey.</p>

<p class='c014'>The children were very much interested in
hearing this, and were not afraid, because grandmamma
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>told them that the bees rarely sting
people when they are swarming; so they went
nearer, and liked to see the gardener take a
board and place it on a flower-pot just under
the rose-tree; then he took a hive and turned
it up and held it under the swarm of bees, and
he shook the rose-tree very sharply twice, and
the lump of bees fell off into the hive, or at
least the greater part of it: and the gardener
turned the hive down with all the bees that were
in it on to the board. A number of bees that
had not fallen into the hive, began to buzz and
fly about; but the gardener said—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘If the queen bee is inside, and I think she is,
the others will soon go to her.’</p>

<p class='c014'>And he raised the hive a little on one side by
putting a pebble under it, and thus made room
enough for the bees to enter the hive.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice, seeing so many bees still
flying about, thought that they were all coming
out again; but the bees knew better; their
queen was in the hive, and content with her
new house, and all the bees went in by degrees,
and soon but very few were seen flying about
the hive.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>The gardener said that he would leave the
hive where it was till the evening, when he
would move it into its proper place.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whilst the gardener was thus busied,
Beatrice cried out, ‘Look! look! what are
those bees doing? Oh, grandmamma, do look
at them!’</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma turned to look, and so did
Alice, and they saw some bees pouring out of
another hive, as if they were blown out of it,
or shot from a gun. Out and out they came
quicker and quicker, pouring thicker and thicker;
and then they rose in the air, and spread about,
and whirled round and round, flying higher and
higher, and it seemed as if the whole air was
filled with bees, and they made quite a noise
when they flew, humming so loud. Grandmamma
told the two children that this was a
swarm from another hive, and added, ‘Now we
must try and watch where they will settle, and
we must follow them. I hope that they will
not fly away, else we shall lose them.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice looked on in great astonishment,
and then followed their grandmamma,
who would not call the gardener or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>ask him to follow this swarm, as he was still
busy with the other.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Are you not afraid, grandmamma, that these
bees will fly away, they fly so high and so
far?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, dear; I think that they will settle soon,
as they begin to fly lower and more together.’
And as she spoke, the cloud of bees came lower
and lower, and soon a black mass was seen on
an apple tree, just between two branches. The
black mass grew larger and larger, till at last
the number of flying bees became less, and they
grew quiet. They covered the branch all
round, and it looked as if something black had
been put round the branch.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How will John get those bees? He cannot
reach them, they are so high up.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘John will bring a ladder, and some one must
hold the board and the hive for him.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice ran to call the gardener, and told him of
the second swarm.</p>

<p class='c014'>John said, ‘That is your luck to-day, miss;
two swarms on one day are very lucky. The
weather is hot, and our hives are so full of
brood, and so heavy, that I dare say they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>glad enough to get rid of some of their numbers
and go into a new hive.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But have you another hive and a board
ready, John?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, miss, to be sure I have. I made ten
new hives this winter, when I had nothing else
to do, and I got the carpenter to cut me a
dozen boards; so we have plenty for all the
swarms that may come. Perhaps, miss, your
grandmamma will like me to take the new
Scotch hive which came last week, so I will
bring that and a straw one, and ask her which
is to be used.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice went with John: and Alice carried the
straw hive, and John carried the Scotch hive,
which was an octagon, or eight-sided, wooden
one, painted red, with glass windows and
shutters; and he took two boards as well, and
they both hastened to the kitchen garden,
where the new swarm of bees had settled.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What luck the little ladies have, ma’am!’
said the gardener. ‘You promised them the
second swarm; and what a fine one it is, much
bigger than the one I have just hived!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, this is the children’s swarm, and I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>glad that it is such a large one. But how will
you take it, John? it is in such an awkward
place.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘With the ladder, quite easy, ma’am; but,’
added John, looking up at it, ‘I can’t shake
them off the branch, and shall have to take
them as I can.’</p>

<p class='c014'>John ran to fetch the ladder, which was close
by against the wall, where he had been pruning
some fruit trees.</p>

<p class='c014'>The little girls were very impatient, and
watched the gardener mount the ladder; then
their grandmamma handed him the Scotch
hive; and to their great astonishment, John
said—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I must sweep these bees into the hive.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The gardener fixed the wooden hive between
the ladder and his own knee, and then with one
rapid sweep with his hands, he threw the whole
lump of bees into the hive, and turned the hive
down on the board.</p>

<p class='c014'>A great number of the bees flew off and rose
again high up into the air, but John said—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Don’t be afraid, ma’am, they never sting
when they are swarming.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Alice and Beatrice began crying out, for the
bees were flying all about their grandmamma;
but John was soon down from the ladder, and
taking the board with the hive upon it very
gently, he placed them carefully on a garden
bench close by, and raising one side of the hive
a little, as he had done with the first swarm,
he left the bees, and they all stood at a little
distance and watched them.</p>

<p class='c014'>The bees still rose in great numbers high
into the air, and whirled about in great confusion,
and John began to fear that the queen
bee was not in the hive; but by degrees they
began to cluster round the hive and cover it.
For it seemed that one or two had found out
that the queen was safely housed in the strange-looking
box, and had told the news to the
others, for they came lower, flying closer and
closer, and crept all over it until they had found
the entrance, and before a quarter of an hour
had passed, there was scarcely a bee to be seen
out of the hive.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You can leave them safely now, I think,
John, till the evening, and then I shall like
these two swarms to be placed in the new bee-house.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>And now you know, dear Alice and
Beatrice, that the Ayrshire hive is yours, and
all the honey the bees make will be yours too.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The little girls were much pleased, and
thanked their grandmamma well. Afterwards
they returned slowly through the hot garden
to the verandah, and they were very glad of its
cool shade.</p>

<p class='c014'>Their grandmamma told them a great deal
about bees: that this immense family, of often
twenty thousand bees, was obedient to one
single bee, a queen bee, who was their mother
and their queen, for whom they worked and
gathered stores of honey, and whom they protected
from all harm. Grandmamma told them
how busy and industrious the bees were, how
early they were up in the summer, and how
many times they flew out and returned ladened
with honey or with pollen which they take from
the flowers, what distances they fly in search
of flowers, and it has been proved that they
will fly even several miles to gather honey.</p>

<p class='c014'>She described to the children how carefully
they laid up a store for the winter; and said
that it was cruel of people to kill the bees to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the honey, instead of being content to take only
what the bees can spare, which is often a great
deal.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I never kill my bees, you know, and I have
plenty of honey—indeed, much more than I
want.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I can say, “How doth the little busy bee!”’
said Beatrice, and her grandmamma let her
repeat the whole of the little hymn, which
Beatrice did very nicely, and grandmamma
said, ‘You will soon see through the little
windows of your new hive “how skilfully she
builds her cells.” I will let you read about the
cells in a nice book called “Homes without
Hands.”</p>

<p class='c014'>‘There is another insect,’ grandmamma went
on, ‘which is very industrious, and lays up a
large store of food for the winter, and that is
the ant. There is a very pretty fable in French
about the ant and the grasshopper, which, when
you are older, I should like you to learn.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But will you tell us about it, grandmamma?’
asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Well then, my Alice, I will try, but I cannot
tell it in the pretty and clever way it is told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>in French. It was thus: One cold stormy
October, a grasshopper, who had skipped and
chirped in the sun all through the summer
time, came to an ant, and said, “Good Mrs.
Ant, you have such a large store of corn and
seed in your hill, will you spare me a little, for
I am very hungry?”’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Now, though the ant was very industrious
I am afraid that she was not very charitable, or
perhaps she thought it was useless to feed lazy
people who will not work; so she answered and
said, “Pray, Mrs. Grasshopper, what did you
do all the summer, while I was working hard,
and laying in a store to keep my children
through the winter?”’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘“Oh, in summer I sang and chirped all the
day long,” replied the grasshopper.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘“Then I advise you,” said the ant, “to
dance now;” and the ant went into her house
in her hill, and left the grasshopper to die.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You know, both of you, what an ant-hill is,
do not you?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, grandmamma, I remember those little
mounds, which I wanted to kick to pieces to
make the ants run about, and you would not let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>me, and told me that it was cruel. Now I
understand that those ant-hills are the ants’
houses, where they live and lay up their food
for the winter.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You are quite right. Here in England the
ant-hills are small, but in other countries they
are as high as you are. When I first saw them
in Russia, I could not believe that they were
ant-hills; and the ants are very little larger
than those here, and yet they can collect such
quantities of earth and leaves, and can raise up
such pyramids for their houses.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The ants are not so good as the bees; they
do not make anything for us, like those nice
busy bees,’ said Alice. ‘I do not like them;
and, besides, the ant was very cross to the poor
grasshopper.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The ant was certainly very uncharitable;
but all animals act only in accordance with
God’s laws. This is a fable to show the difference
between industrious and idle people.
God has taught all creatures who are to live
through the winter, to labour and lay up stores;
but the grasshopper and butterflies who flutter
in the sunshine, and many other insects, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>God’s will are made to live only for a short
time, and therefore do not need to store food
like the ant and the bee.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The industrious ant serves in the fable to
show us that we ought all to work, and you
know from the Bible, that God has ordained
that man should earn his bread in the sweat of
his brow, which means by <i>working</i>. The poor
man works, or ought to work, with his hands,
the gentleman, or the educated man, with his
head; but work is ordered for all—for the queen
in her palace, and for little children at school.’</p>

‘ALICE and Beatrice,’ said grandmamma
one morning, ‘make haste
and eat a good breakfast, for we are
going to spend the day at Branscombe.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Branscombe! Oh, how nice, grandmamma!
But how are we going? Are we going to
walk?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, dear children, we are going in a boat.
The weather is so fine to-day, and there is so
little wind, and John Bartlett tells me he thinks
that it will remain fine; and therefore we will
go in his boat to Branscombe, and see the
beautiful rocks there.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice made haste; they were
very much pleased to go in a boat, for they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>never been before on the sea. The little girls
would have eaten no breakfast, unless grandmamma
had told them that the sea air would
make them very hungry, and that they must try
and eat their breakfast properly. They were
told that they were to have their dinner at
Branscombe, which pleased them much.</p>

<p class='c014'>The cook had provided a nice dinner, and
had packed it into a basket; and the gardener
carried it down the steep path and steps to the
sea-shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last grandmamma said, ‘Now you have
been very good children; run upstairs, and ask
Mary to dress you.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice ran upstairs; and whilst
Mary was taking out their hats and jackets,
they both sat down on the carpet and pulled
off their shoes, and put on their thick boots,
and stood very quiet when Mary buttoned their
little white jackets and tied on their hats.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I will put your cloaks with your grandmamma’s,’
said Mary, ‘because it will be cold
when you come back.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Cold!’ cried Alice, ‘this hot day. Oh,
Mary, we cannot want our cloaks!’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>‘On the sea it is often cold, Miss Alice; and
it may be late when you return,’ added Mary.</p>

<p class='c014'>The three cloaks were put together, and the
children were glad to see that Mary was to come
with them in the boat.</p>

<p class='c014'>When they came to the shore, there was John
Bartlett waiting for them, and a very nice large
boat, half on the sand and half in the water,
and there was another sailor there, and a little
boy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Little Beatrice said, ‘Grandmamma, that is
Jack; I know Jack, he brings us nice shrimps
for our tea; don’t you Jack?’ and the boy
smiled. ‘I am so glad that Jack is going with
us.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The sea was very smooth, and the tide was
neither high nor low, and there were no waves.</p>

<p class='c014'>The children were lifted into the boat, after
grandmamma and Mary had walked along a
sloping plank into it, and had seated themselves
at the end, where there were cushions, and Alice
and Beatrice sat on the cushions on each side
of their grandmamma.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bartlett and the little boy jumped into the
boat; and the other man first pushed the boat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>deeper into the sea, going into the water himself,
and then climbed into the boat; and
Bartlett and his boy, each with an oar, rowed a
little till they were away from the shore, and
the boat tossed up and down, and Alice and
Beatrice came close to grandmamma and looked
afraid.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma then took Beatrice on her lap,
and said—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘A boat always rocks up and down at first;
as soon as the sails are up, it will be much
quieter.’</p>

<p class='c014'>So they did not cry; but Beatrice said, ‘I
should like to go back best.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘May we go back?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, dear children, you must wait a little,
and then I think that you will like the boat very
much. Look at little Jack Bartlett, how he
helps his father to unroll the sail and to pull
the ropes.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The children looked, and saw the sailor and
his boy unroll a large piece of cloth; they knew
that it was a sail, and they saw the men pull it
up a high pole, which Alice told her sister was
called a mast. The sail was red, and had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>little hole in it. The wind blew upon the sail
and made it straight; then the two men put
up another sail, and little Jack came to sit near
grandmamma, at her end of the boat.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was so much to look at, that the
children soon forgot their fear, and Alice asked—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What is Jack doing at our end of the boat?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘He is steering, miss,’ said Bartlett.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But what is steering?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Steering means guiding the boat; and this
is done by a piece of wood at the end, which
Jack moves backwards and forwards in the
water, and this makes the boat go to the right
or to the left, as his father tells him.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How funny that is! How can a bit of wood
make a boat go one way or another?’ said
Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I cannot explain it to you now, dear Alice;
but when you are older I will show you how it
moves, and what it does. This piece of wood
is called the rudder;’ and Alice watched the
rudder some little time.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Why is there a hole in the sail, Jack?’ asked
little Beatrice. ‘Is the sail old?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, little miss,’ said Bartlett, ‘it is quite a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>new sail; but a lady let her dog make that hole
only last week.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Why did she let her dog make that hole and
spoil your new sail?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The lady was playing with her dog, as she
sat on the beach, and threw stones for him to
fetch; and at last she threw a stone on to the
sail, that was lying next my boat, and the dog
jumped upon the sail, and turned it over the
stone, and then he bit and gnawed at the sail
to get it out. The lady did not think what
harm she did me in letting her dog make a hole
in my new sail,’ said the boatman.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Did she not give you anything for the
mischief her dog had done?’ asked grandmamma.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, ma’am, nothing; and she did not even
say that she was sorry, but took no notice, and
walked away.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘That was naughty of her,’ said Beatrice;
‘I will not let our good dog Wolf bite any sail.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The wind filled the sails, and the boat glided
quickly through the water. The children began
to enjoy the pleasant movement, and liked to
watch the mark in the water that the boat left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>behind it; and asked if they might put their
hands into the clear green water, which grandmamma
allowed them to do.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice soon cried out, ‘Oh, grandmamma, how
far I can see into the sea! How deep it is,
and how green, and how pretty!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Very pretty,’ repeated Beatrice; and both
children looked long over the side of the boat.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What is Jack doing now?’ asked the children
suddenly, when they saw the boy unwind
some cord from a piece of wood, and throw the
end of it into the sea; then he threw another
piece of cord, and then another, till at last there
were four strings in the sea, two on each side
the boat.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘He is fishing,’ said grandmamma.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Fishing!’ cried Alice; ‘please tell me how
he is fishing.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Each of these cords has a hook at the end
of it,’ said grandmamma, ‘and on each hook is
a little bit of fish or meat. When the fish try
to catch hold of it to eat it, the hook sticks in
their throats, and they cannot get away.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Just now Bartlett called to his boy, and said,
‘Jack, you have got a fish on that line;’ so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Jack pulled up the line—and it was a very long
piece of string—and at the end hung a fish.
The boy took it and put it into the other end of
the boat, and threw his line in again. The fish
jumped at first up and down, but it soon lay
still; and soon several other fishes were caught,
and all thrown together into the end of the boat.</p>

<p class='c014'>The little girls were sorry, for they did not
like seeing the fishes hurt.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Jack,’ said his father, ‘go back to the rudder,
for we must try and land soon. There is Branscombe
now, young ladies.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The children looked and saw that they were
coming quite close to the land again. The rocks
were no longer red in colour, as at Salcombe,
but white, and very different in shape; and there
was a wide valley between these rocks and hills,
and a very few houses were in the valley, not
far from the sea-shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What a large ship that is! Shall we go
close to it?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, quite close, miss; it is full of coals, and
the people on board are putting the coals into
sacks, and then they let down the sacks into
those big boats.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Their boat soon came quite near the large
ship, which grandmamma told the children was
called a collier, because it always carried coals
from one place to another. The children looked
hard at the ship, as they had never been so
close to a ship before. Then they sailed past
the collier, and soon came up to the big black
boat, and saw that it was full of sacks of coals,
and they soon passed that. Beatrice thought
that the men who were rowing the boat looked
very black and dirty.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The coals make the men black, Beatrice,’
aid Alice. ‘If we played with coals, our hands
and our dresses would be quite black too.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But do these men play with the coals?’
asked little Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No; to be sure they do not. Did you not see
how the men put the coals into the sacks, and
how the dust flew about on the ship? That is
enough to make anybody black and dirty.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The boat now came nearer and nearer to the
land, and the little girls looked eagerly, and
asked how they should get on shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Quite easy, little miss,’ said Bartlett. ‘Now,
please sit quite quiet, and we will run her on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>shore. But please, ma’am, will you sit in the
middle of the boat?’ which grandmamma and
Mary did immediately; and the two sailors let
down the sails, and took the oars and rowed
hard, and in a very few minutes the boat went
on to the shore, the one end much higher than
the other end. The men jumped on to the
shore; and when the next wave came and lifted
the boat, they pulled it by a rope, and brought
it up much higher on the shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Please take me out, Bartlett,’ cried Beatrice.
‘And me too,’ said Alice. ‘May we go, grandmamma?’
asked the children; and as the
answer was ‘Yes,’ the children went to the
higher end of the boat, and were lifted on to
the shore, and grandmamma and Mary and Jack
followed them. The great basket that the cook
had packed was taken out, and the cloaks and
umbrellas.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Take all the things up to the farm-house,
please, Bartlett,’ said grandmamma, ‘and tell
Mrs. Wilmot that we shall soon come up.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The children, in the meantime, were looking
at something which amused them very much.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were a number of horses—about twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>(for Alice counted them)—which all walked, one
after each other, with no one to guide them, up
to the big black boat that had brought the
sacks of coal, and had just reached the shore.
The horses, one after another, went into the
water to the side of the boat; and when the
men had laid a sack of coals across each horse’s
back, the horses went away out of the water in
a row, and up the shore, and carried the sacks
in front of a large house, where some men took
off the sacks, emptied each sack, and threw
them over the backs of the horses, which then
turned round and went back again to the boat.
Thus there were always two rows of horses, one
row going to the sea, and the other returning
loaded with sacks of coals.</p>

<p class='c014'>The little girls were very much pleased to see
how clever the horses were—how regularly they
went, never stopping behind, but on and on till
they reached the right place. They liked to
see each horse come up to the edge of the sea,
put down its head for an instant, as if to see
how deep the water was, and step in until it
reached the boat, then wait till its turn came,
and take the place of the last horse that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>loaded. The horses did not seem to mind the
waves that washed up against them, for the
tide was high, and there were more waves than
when the children landed.</p>

<p class='c014'>After Alice and Beatrice had looked a long
time, they turned away from the sea, and went
up the path that led through a green field up
the side of the valley, and followed their grandmamma
till they came to an old farm-house.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were very hot and tired, for the path
was long and very steep, and the sun shone
bright, and they found the weather much
warmer on the land than on the sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a large tree in front of the house,
and it was so shady and cool there, that grandmamma
asked the farmer’s wife if she would
let them have a table and some chairs under
the tree, as they would like to sit in the shade,
and eat their dinner out of doors.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Wilmot, the farmer’s wife, then ordered
a table and some chairs, and Alice and Beatrice
sat down and rested a little, for they were
tired; but very soon they began to run up and
down the sloping side of the hill, and laughed
when some sheep that were feeding there began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>to run about too; and they chased the sheep
about, till at last the sheep leaped over the
hedge at the end of the field, and began to
jump from one rock to another.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice followed the sheep; but,
on going through the gate, they saw that they
were near the sea, which lay below the steep
cliff; and large pieces of white rock, that
sparkled in the sun, lay half-way down, as if
they had fallen down.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You must not go so near the edge,’ said
Mary, who had followed them. ‘Miss Beatrice,
give me your hand, and I will let you look
down into the sea.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I can take care of myself,’ said Alice;
‘please let me, Mary. Oh, I never saw such
beautiful rocks! I wish that grandmamma
were here, she would like so much to see them.
What is that large white piece further on—it
goes so far into the sea?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘That is Portland, a sort of island; it is a
long way off; only to-day the air is so clear
that we can see it easily. But we must go
back to your grandmamma,’ added Mary. ‘Are
you not hungry?’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>‘Oh yes, so hungry, Mary! Let us go back
to the nice farm-house.’ And they ran quickly
back again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice found the table spread
with a white table-cloth, and some nice things
on it ready for their dinner. The farmer’s wife
had lent some plates, and had put some milk
and some cream on the table, and some of her
own brown bread; and the children drank the
milk, and grandmamma gave them some fruit
tart, with a little of the nice cream.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is very good of the farmer’s wife to give
us such nice things,’ said Alice; ‘everything
tastes so much better than what we have at
home, I think. But I was very hungry and
thirsty; perhaps that’s why I like everything
so much to-day.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think that is one of the reasons, dear
Alice,’ was the answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is nice to have our dinner under this
tree: do you not like it, grandmamma!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, very much.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘And so do I, grandmamma,’ said little
Beatrice.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_0'>
SOON after dinner grandmamma went
with the children to the pretty green
field which sloped down to the white
rocks.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What is that little white thing,’ asked
Beatrice, ‘up there, grandmamma? Look,
please—it moves, it runs, it is alive!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘And there, too, and there!’ cried Alice; ‘how
many little animals! What can they be?’</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma looked too, and said, ‘They
are rabbits, little white rabbits.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Rabbits!’ said Alice; ‘I thought that rabbits
were brown.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, so they are, my dear, that is the wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>rabbits are brown; but tame rabbits are of different
colours, some white, some black, or grey,
or spotted. I do not know how these tame
rabbits came here.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘May we go nearer and look at them?’ both
the children asked; and they went much nearer,
and they saw a great number of white rabbits
running about in a green field higher up the
hill than the one they were walking in. The
children liked to look at these rabbits running
about and playing with each other.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Why are these white rabbits called tame?’
asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Tame animals are those that are taken
care of and fed. For, as these pretty white or
black rabbits are not so strong as the brown
ones, they are usually kept in little houses,
and fed with cabbage leaves and other food,
because the cold in winter might kill them. In
Devonshire the winter is not very cold; so I
suppose that these rabbits do not suffer from
it, and that they have learnt to make themselves
warm houses in the earth, as the wild
rabbits do.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Will you tell us, grandmamma, how the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>wild rabbits make themselves houses in the
ground?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘They make or burrow holes in the ground,
digging out the earth with their feet, as you
must have seen a dog scratching and digging
with his feet. But the rabbits dig long passages
under the earth, and often near or under
a tree. I have read that the rabbits first dig
down straight till the hole is deep, and that
then they make a passage, and sometimes turn
upwards again, or make it crooked, to prevent
dogs finding them and killing them.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Rabbits live together in great numbers, and
it is called a warren. They like a sandy or
gravelly soil to burrow in, and make the entrance
to the little house often under a furze
bush that it may not be seen. Sometimes they
loosen the roots of trees so much that the trees
fall; and where there are many rabbits in a
warren, the ground is very unsafe, for if any
one was riding, the horse’s foot might go
through, and he would fall, and perhaps break
his leg and throw his rider. Even in walking
you might stumble, by getting your foot into a
rabbit hole, which is not easily seen. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>heard, too, that rabbits have undermined walls
and buildings, and made them unsafe.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What is undermined, grandmamma?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It means making a hole or mine under the
ground; and when these holes are made in
soft sand or gravel beneath a heavy wall, it will
fall into the hole.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Will you tell us what the wild rabbit eats?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It eats nearly everything it can get; but it
is very fond of all our vegetables, and would
soon spoil our gardens if it came into them.
The wild rabbit lives in the fields and meadows
and woods, and eats the young buds of the
bushes and young trees; it likes especially the
tender roots of the furze bushes, and it nibbles
the soft bark of the trees, and spoils a great
number of them. There are also many plants
and roots that it lives on.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The children then asked to go to the end of
the field, and look down on to the sea beneath;
and they all went on walking till they came to
the edge of the field. The two little girls
called out with pleasure and surprise, for they
saw beyond and below them a number of large
rocks, which looked like great towers, close to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the steep cliff, on the edge of which they were
now standing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some of these rocks were slender and pointed,
and sharp on the top, and many were strangely
shaped, and lay scattered about; but one tall
piece of rock stood out alone, nearly in the sea,
as if it had been cut off the cliff, and on the top
was perched a sea-gull.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Oh, grandmamma, look at that sea-gull!’
cried Alice; ‘how can it stand on the point of
that high rock?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The sea-gull need not be afraid of standing
there,’ said grandmamma, ‘for if its foot should
slip, its wings would keep it from falling; and
should it even fall, which is not likely, it would
not be drowned, for the sea-gull swims well on
a stormy sea.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How wonderful it is that it can swim and
fly so well!’ said Alice. ‘It can fly much
better than a goose or a duck, and they can
swim and fly a little.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘God, in His great mercy, has made the wild
bird fly and swim much better than the tame
bird. The sea-gull provides its own food by
diving into the waves and catching fish, and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>flies about in stormy weather and swims on the
wild waves. Man, or people, take care of the
duck and goose, and feed it, so it does not want
to fly far, or swim on rough seas.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How very wonderful it is!’ said Alice; and
little Beatrice listened attentively, although she
could not understand it all.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘God’s wisdom is always wonderful, my
child, and God’s love is very great. As God
provides for the sea-gull and for all animals,
and gives them all their food, and takes care of
them all, so God takes care of us all, and gives us
food and clothes, and everything that we want.
God, as you know, gives us summer and winter,
sunshine and snow and rain, and all for our
good. God has made the earth beautiful, the
grass green, the flowers gay, the sea wide, and
the heavens high; and we must never forget to
thank God for everything, and for His care of
us by day and by night.’</p>

<p class='c014'>They sat down on the edge of the cliff and
rested, and looked at the beautiful sight before
them; and when they had seen the sea-gull
spread its wide wings and fly over the sea, and
they had watched it till they could see it no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>longer, they turned back to the farm-house.
There they found Mary had put everything
ready, and Bartlett was waiting.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma thanked the farmer’s wife, and
she and the children bade her good-bye; and
after grandmamma had asked Mary if she had
given the sailors a good dinner, and Mary had answered
that she had, they all went down the side
of the hill to the shore, where little Jack and the
other sailor were waiting by the side of the boat.</p>

<p class='c014'>They all stepped into the boat, and were
pushed off, and after a little rocking to and fro,
which no longer frightened the children, two
sails were hoisted, and as there was more wind
now, the boat went much quicker.</p>

<p class='c014'>Soon the little girls said, ‘How cold it is!’
for the wind blew strong; and Mary put their
cloaks about them, and little Beatrice crept on
to her grandmamma’s lap, and soon fell asleep,
for she was very tired.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice sat between her grandmamma and
Mary, and talked the whole way. She had so
many things to ask about; and she made
Bartlett tell her about his little girls at home,
who had no mother.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>The sailor told Alice that his eldest girl kept
his house clean and neat, and cooked the
dinner, and looked after the little ones.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Do your little boys and girls go to school,
Bartlett?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, miss, they all go; and it is a very nice
school. They learn to read and write very
nicely, and the little girls learn to sew.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Can Jack swim, Bartlett?’ she asked again.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, not yet, for I have not much time to
teach him.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Not yet! Why, Jack is older than I am,
and grandmamma says that I must learn to
swim next summer.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But, dear Alice, how can Jack learn to
swim if his father has not the time to teach
him?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Bartlett, you will teach Jack to swim when
you have time, will you not? Grandmamma
says that if people do not learn to swim, when
they fall into the water by accident, they will
be drowned.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The sailor promised the little girl that he
would make Jack swim very soon.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the boat sailed past the high red cliffs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>before they reached home, Alice spied a man
and an ass on a narrow piece of rock some way
down the steep side of the high cliff, and asked
the sailor how and why the man had taken his
donkey to such a place.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It must be so dangerous. Look, Bartlett
how they are going along, they must fall!’
and Alice looked quite uneasy and frightened.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Bartlett soon explained to her that some
poor people made gardens on tiny plots of
ground among the ledges of the steep cliff, and
planted them with potatoes; and as these little
strips of ground slope towards the noon-day
sun, and are protected from the cold north
winds by the rising cliff, these people have
potatoes earlier than any one else. He told
her that by setting their potatoes in September
or October, the potatoes were ready in early
spring, and were often sent to London and sold
for a great deal of money.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sailor told the little girl that nothing
but a donkey was sure-footed enough to carry
down the baskets of manure for these little
gardens, and to bring up the potatoes; that no
horse could tread safe where these asses walk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>firmly and steadily, choosing their own paths.
‘As you see, Miss Alice, that donkey is going
on alone with his load, and the man is following
him as he best can;  and the man knows
that it is safest to walk where his ass has gone
already.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How clever donkeys must be, grandmamma!’
said Alice. ‘I thought that donkeys
were always stupid. But how can it know
where it is safe to walk?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘By instinct, dear child. Instinct is a knowledge
which comes of itself, and is given to
animals by God. Another time I will tell you
about it.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Bartlett began to pull down the sails, and
called to Jack to steer for the land, as they
were now close to their own shore. Little
Beatrice woke up in time to see how some
very large waves lifted the boat, and brought
it up high on the shingle. The sailors
jumped out, and helped first the children and
then grandmamma and Mary out of the boat.
Before they went up the steps from the shore,
they thanked Bartlett and bade him and Jack
‘good-bye.’</p>

THE next day, at breakfast, Alice asked
when they might go in a boat again.
‘I like it so much, grandmamma. I
love to be on the sea.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I like it too, my Alice; but we must not go
often; for yesterday you know we did nothing
else but amuse ourselves, and now we will stay
at home and work and do lessons.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Please, ma’am,’ said Mary, entering the room
rather hastily, ‘Mrs. Dunne’s little girl has
been scalded with hot water. Will you please
go and see the poor child? The boy says that
she is screaming so much.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, indeed I will; but whilst I am putting
on my cloak and bonnet, get me some cotton-wool;
you will find some in the lowest drawer.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Alice and Beatrice were very sorry that the
little child was hurt, for they knew the child
quite well, and they sometimes went to the
village to see Mrs. Dunne, who was a washer-woman.</p>

<p class='c014'>Their grandmamma told Mary to bring the
two little girls to meet her in an hour’s time, and
walked very quickly to the village.</p>

<p class='c014'>When she came near Mrs. Dunne’s cottage
she heard the child’s screams; so she opened
the door, and went in. Mrs. Dunne was holding
the little girl on her lap; and the poor child
was crying as loud as she could, and her mother
was crying too.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Mrs. Dunne,’ said grandmamma, ‘put little
Betsy on the bed, and show me where she is
hurt.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Little Betsy knew the lady, and looked up at
her, and left off crying for one minute; and
whilst her mother put her on the bed, grandmamma
made a glass of sugar and water and
held it to the child to drink, and though she
still went on crying, she did not scream so loud,
and Mrs. Dunne was able to show the lady where
her child was hurt.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>The little leg was very red, and was covered
with large blisters. The lady first took off the
poor child’s shoe, and then drew off her little
sock so quietly that it did not hurt her, and
wrapped the whole leg and foot in the cotton-wool
she had brought, and wound it round and
round with some broad tape.</p>

<p class='c014'>The little girl soon appeared to have less pain,
for her cries were less; and then Mrs. Dunne
told the lady how her poor little Betsy, who
was but four years old, had met with this accident.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But I am glad that the boiling water that
went on to her leg did not go into my dear child’s
face or neck, for then it would have been much
worse.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You see, Mrs. Dunne, that in everything we
have reason to thank God for His mercy.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Dunne, wiping her
eyes: ‘I thank God, and you too, that you have
come and helped me so kindly.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I will leave Betsy some medicine,’ said the
lady, ‘and I will come again in the evening and
see how the poor child is; but do not move the
cotton-wool on any account.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Whilst Betsy’s medicine was preparing, Mrs.
Dunne was pleased to see that her little child
was much easier; and after the lady had given
her a spoonful of the medicine, she went away,
and she met Alice and Beatrice not far from the
cottage.</p>

<p class='c014'>The two children had their hoops, and were
running with them till they saw grandmamma
in the distance; then they stopped their hoops,
and came running to meet her.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How is poor little Betsy?’ asked Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Where is she hurt, grandmamma?’ asked
Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma told them all about Betsy,
and what she had done for her, and said that
the little girl was much easier when she left
her.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘May we take her something nice for her
dinner or for her tea?’ asked Alice: to which
Beatrice added, ‘Please let us, grandmamma.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You may take Betsy a little basketful of
strawberries, and you may gather them yourselves.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Thank you, dear grandmamma,’ said the
little girls; ‘may we go now for them?’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>‘No, not now, dear children,’ said grandmamma;
‘you must come in and do your
lessons.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Do let us go first and pull some strawberries,’
said they.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No; I cannot let you go till after your dinner.’
Upon which, Alice and Beatrice seemed very
much inclined to cry, but they knew that their
grandmamma did not like them to ask again after
she had refused; so they walked on slowly, and
did not speak at first.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last Alice said, ‘Why did you wrap Betsy’s
leg up in cotton-wool, grandmamma?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Because it has been found that cotton-wool
lessens the pain of a burn, and helps to make it
get well.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How did people find this out?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘There is a pretty story about it, and I will
tell it you:—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘In North America the cotton plant grows—for
this white wool grows on a small plant—and
the plant has little pods. You know what
a pod is, do you not?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, grandmamma; a pea has a pod, and
the peas are in it.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>‘Well, the cotton plant has a pod which
holds its seeds—of a different shape to the
peas-pod, and not so long or so large; but the
seeds are wrapped up in this soft woolly stuff,
which the negroes pick and clean and wash.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It happened once that the little child of a
poor negro woman was burnt all over—I do not
know how; and as the mother had nothing to
put on, she laid her little screaming child down
on a heap of the picked cotton-wool, and returned
to her work. After she had finished her
appointed work she went to her child, and
found that in its pain it had rolled about in the
cotton-wool till it was covered with the wool,
and was lying quiet and asleep; and the poor
negro woman was very glad.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Some one who had seen the accident, and
also seen the child asleep, examined the child,
and found that the blisters had gone down, and
the burnt places, which had been quite red,
were nearly well.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘After this, people tried cotton-wool for burns,
and found it nearly always of the greatest
service in relieving the pain and healing the
injuries.’</p>

<p>Basket of Strawberries for the Burnt Child.—<i>Page <a href='#Page_91'>91</a>.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>‘Thank you, grandmamma; that is a nice
story. How glad that poor woman must have
been to find her little child nearly well!’</p>

<p class='c014'>Now they were quite close to their own
house, their own dog came running to them,
and jumped up at them, and nearly threw little
Beatrice down, which made her laugh, and she
said, ‘Down, Wolf, down. Grandmamma,
Wolf will kiss me, he has licked my face.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘And he has licked mine too,’ said her sister.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wolf ran on in front, and then turned back to
the children, and played with them and jumped
round them, and they had already forgotten
their disappointment about the strawberries.</p>

<p class='c014'>When they were in the house again, they
both tried to be very good and obedient, and
they were very attentive to everything their
grandmamma said to them.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the afternoon they were very happy gathering
the strawberries for the poor little burnt
child, and each of them had a very pretty little
basket; and the gardener showed them how to
put strawberry leaves into their baskets first,
and then to put the ripe strawberries upon the
leaves till the baskets were nearly full. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>they gathered some more leaves to cover over
the strawberries. Alice and Beatrice ran back
to the house and showed their baskets to their
grandmamma, and lifted the leaves a little that
she might see the strawberries. She told them
that they were good children, and that she
would go with them to Mrs. Dunne’s cottage,
as she wished to see how the poor little child
was. They found little Betsy sitting up on her
mother’s bed, looking very happy.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I return you many thanks, ma’am, for the
nice broth you sent Betsy, and for the milk.
She has just finished eating her broth, for she
fell asleep soon after you went away this morning,
and her leg does not seem to hurt her
now.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I am very glad to hear it,’ said the lady;
‘but you must leave the cotton-wool on her leg
and foot for a few days, and then I expect that
the skin will be quite well again.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Look, Betsy!’ cried Beatrice, ‘look at these
strawberries!’ And Alice and Beatrice held
their baskets to the little child, who lifted up
the leaves and called out with joy, ‘Strawberries,
mammy, pretty strawberries!’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>‘Eat them,’ said Alice, ‘they are for you; we
gathered them for you.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Little Betsy put a large ripe strawberry into
her mouth, and Alice and Beatrice stood next
the bed, and were glad that the little girl liked
what they had brought her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Dunne thanked them, and emptied the
fruit on to two plates, and gave the children back
their baskets; and then they bade Mrs. Dunne
and Betsy good-bye, and went home.</p>

THE summer was not yet over, but
the weather had changed; the days
were a little shorter, and the children
could no longer bathe regularly, for it
was often very stormy; and the waves were
so very high and rough, that they only went
down to the sea-shore to watch the big waves
rising up high, and then, bending their white
heads over, come dashing high up on the shore—often
so high that the two little girls had to
run away fast, for fear that the waves should
cover their feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Beatrice!’ said Alice, one day, ‘you ought
to learn “Roll on, roll on, you restless waves.”’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I do know it, Alice; only I cannot say all
of it.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>‘Then I will teach it you,’ said Alice; and
she repeated all four verses several times, till
little Beatrice could say them nicely.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma was very pleased when they
came home, to hear little Beatrice say the
following pretty verses to her:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Roll on, roll on, you restless waves,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>That toss about and roar;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Why do you all run back again</div>
      <div class='line in3'>When you have reached the shore?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Roll on, roll on, you noisy waves,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Roll higher up the strand;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>How is it that you cannot pass</div>
      <div class='line in3'>That line of yellow sand?’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘We may not dare,’ the waves reply:</div>
      <div class='line in3'>‘That line of yellow sand</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Is laid along the shore, to bound</div>
      <div class='line in3'>The waters and the land.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And all should keep to time and place,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And all should keep to rule—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Both waves upon the sandy shore,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And little boys at school.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>And grandmamma kissed both the little girls,
and said that they were good children.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day it was very stormy; the rain fell
fast, the wind howled and whistled, and the
children could not go out.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>‘I fear that the summer is nearly over; but
it is very early,’ said grandmamma, ‘to have
such stormy weather. You have both been
very good and attentive; will you like to hear
something more about Russia and the cold
winter there? But, Alice, take that tea-cloth
to hem, and, Beatrice, bring your old dress, I
will show you where to unpick it; and when
you are both of you busy and quiet, I will
begin.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma took her work, and began
thus:—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It was in winter, when your dear mamma
and aunt were both little children of about your
age; the snow was very deep, and the weather
had been very cold; and all the rivers were
frozen so hard that every one could drive across
them. In Russia there are a great many bogs,
which in summer are so wet and soft that no
one can go near them; but in winter, people
drive on the frozen bogs when they are covered
with snow.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But why do not people drive along the roads
in winter?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Because the roads are often filled with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>snow-drifts, and also because it is often much
straighter and nearer to drive across the rivers
and the bogs. But it is very difficult, when dark,
to find the road on these wide and lonely moors
or bogs, especially when it snows, and the fresh
falling snow covers the track.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Were you not afraid, grandmamma, to drive
in those lonely places?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘At first I was, my Alice, but I soon became
accustomed to it.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Please, Alice, do not talk,’ said little Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Well, my dear children, I was telling you
what a cold winter we had; but though the
weather was very cold and rather stormy, your
dear mamma and aunt drove with me one afternoon
in a large sledge drawn by two black
horses, and my good old coachman drove us,
and a man servant was with us. We drove to
call on one of our neighbours, and, as is the
custom in that part of the country, we stayed
to tea there. The tea was late and the servants
slow, for after I had given the order that our
sledge should come round it was delayed; and
I inquired several times, and grew impatient,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>for I did not like to keep my two little girls up
so long, or drive home across the lonely moor
so late at night, and we had six or seven miles
to drive.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘At length I was told that my sledge was at
the door; and my little girls were soon dressed
in their warm winter cloaks and bonnets, and
the servants covered us well with our rugs lined
with fur, and we had some pillows put in over
our feet to keep us warm.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘When we set off, and I could look about me
a little, I found that the weather was very bad;
the snow fell fast, and the wind blew hard, and
drifted the snow in heaps across the road, so I
knew at once that our drive home would be
slow and tedious.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The horses have bells in winter; and they
shook their heads, and the bells sounded cheerfully;
and the horses set off briskly homewards
until we came to the great bog. At first all
went well, and I was glad, till we came to
about half-way; the coachman then began driving
very slowly, and at last stopped the horses.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘“What is the matter, Mart?” I asked;
“have you lost the road?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>‘“Yes, ma’am, I have; and the horses sink
into the snow so deep that they can hardly go
on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The footman jumped down, and said that
he would go and look for the road.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Look for the road!’ said Alice, laughing;
‘how funny! How could the footman find the
road if it was quite dark?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is never quite dark in winter in Russia,
because the snow gives some light.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The man, however, walked about, and went
so far off, that the coachman grew impatient,
and, thinking that he would find the road
quicker himself, jumped off his seat and left us
alone with the horses, who pawed up the snow
and shook their bells and harness; and your
aunt and mamma were sleepy and tired and
very cold.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I took little mamma on my lap, and wrapped
her up in my large fur cloak, and covered dear
little aunty with the pillows, and made her
comfortable and warm in her corner, so that
she might go to sleep. But I myself was very
cold, and was very uneasy too; for I did not
like my little girls to be out late at night, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>in such bad weather; and my feet ached with
cold. I tried to wait patiently, and was glad
that I could see the figures of the two men in
the distance. At length the coachman came
back to us, and began to look at the snow close
to us; and to our great joy he found that the
beaten track was close by, only covered with
the fresh fallen snow. He shouted to the footman,
and he was soon back and seated next the
coachman: and the horses seemed as glad as
we were to be going home at last, and set off
so briskly, that we were soon safe at home; but
it was nearly eleven o’clock, for we had been
just three hours on the road, which we usually
drove in one hour. We were very glad to be
home again, and I thanked God in my prayers
that my little girls were safe.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Oh, grandmamma!’ said Beatrice, ‘I should
be afraid to drive about in that way. I should
not like to live in Russia.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘My darling, you would not be afraid if I
were with you, and told you that God was
watching over us, and that God would take
care of us and defend us from all harm there, in
cold Russia as in our dear England.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>‘Thank you, dear grandmamma,’ said Alice,
‘I like that story; but still I should not like to
drive in the snow across those large moors in
winter in Russia.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But tell me, please, how can people find
such snowy roads if there are no hedges to show
them where they are?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The road is easily found by men and horses,
because, where the snow has been trodden
down and driven on, it is hard and firm, and all
around is soft and deep; and, therefore, when
the horses sink deep into the snow, the driver
knows that they are not on the track or right
road.’</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE two little girls received an invitation
from a farmer’s wife, who lived
in a valley not very far off, to come
and see the first cider made.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘May we go, dear grandmamma, may we
go?’ said Alice and Beatrice; ‘we shall like it
so much!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I want very much to know how cider is
made,’ said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Then you must try and learn all about it
to-morrow; and what you do not understand,
you must ask Mrs. Laurence to tell you.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The children were very impatient for to-morrow,
and were delighted the next morning
to see that it was a fine and sunny day, and
very warm.</p>

<p class='c014'>After their early dinner, the two little girls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>went with Mary over a low part of the hill, and
down a steep road into the valley where Mrs.
Laurence lived, who was very glad to see
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Laurence took the children first into her
kitchen, a large room where a good fire was
burning, although it was so warm out of doors.
Mary took off their cloaks, and put them down
on a chair in the corner; and Mrs. Laurence
took the little girls out of another door, and they
walked through her nice little garden, which
had a number of beautiful rose trees in full
bloom. The farmer’s wife told Alice and
Beatrice that her boys liked to keep the garden
in order after they had done their farm work,
and that they had budded all these roses, and
she was very proud of her flowers.</p>

<p class='c014'>When they came to the large open yard at the
back of the house, they saw a number of geese
come flying down the hill that rose up all round
the yard; and the children stopped to see the
geese come one after another with a great noise,
and the sound they made with their wings was
very loud and very strange; and they asked why
it was.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>‘It is because the geese are so very heavy, and
do not fly much—only now and then, when
they want to come quickly to some place,’ said
Mrs. Laurence.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is a sign of stormy weather coming,’ said
Ellen, Mrs. Laurence’s eldest girl, ‘when the
geese fly about and scream so: is it not,
mother?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, I have heard so, and I believe that the
geese are always right; and I daresay we shall
have some bad storms soon.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How do the geese know that there will be
stormy weather soon?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘God has given them the sense to see it coming,’
said Mary; ‘and dogs eat grass just before
it rains.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But I do not understand,’ said Alice, ‘how
the geese see the bad weather coming.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You had better ask your grandmamma, Miss
Alice,’ said Mary; ‘she will tell you all about
it.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The little girls then followed Ellen across the
yard; it was very dirty and wet, for it had
rained the day before; but Ellen took Beatrice
in her arms, and showed Alice how to step on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>several large stones that were there, perhaps on
purpose that people might step on them, and
not go in the mud or water.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two pretty dark-red cows, with long slender
horns, were standing under an open shed; and
Ellen went up to one of them, after she had first
brought a clean wooden pail and a little stool,
and she sat down on the little stool, and put the
pail in front of her knees, and then she milked
two streams of white warm milk into the pail,
and it was all white froth, like the froth upon
the waves, and the cow turned round its head
and looked at the children.</p>

<p class='c014'>They might have been, perhaps, a little
afraid; but Ellen said, ‘You may stroke her,
miss, she is such a good cow.’</p>

<p class='c014'>So Alice put out her hand, and rubbed the
cow’s head, and patted her.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Will you like to give her an apple?’ said
Ellen to Alice; and Alice took an apple that
Ellen gave her, and went to the cow and held
out the apple to her; but when Alice saw the
cow’s head come so close to her, and her long
tongue put out to take the apple, Alice jumped
back, and threw the apple at the cow, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>stretched out her neck to reach it, but could
not.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Why, Alice,’ said little Beatrice, ‘you never
gave the cow the apple. Were you afraid?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I did try to give her the apple; but her
tongue was so very long, that I was afraid that
she would get hold of my hand, so I threw her
the apple.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I will pick it up, and give it to the poor cow,’
said Beatrice. ‘Do cows like apples?’ she
asked, after she had picked it up and given it to
the cow, who ate it very quickly.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes,’ answered Ellen; ‘cows are very fond
of apples, and get plenty of them when they
feed in our orchard; and horses and pigs and
sheep all like apples.’</p>

<p class='c014'>After Ellen had milked four cows, and showed
the little girls a pretty red calf, and given it a
pailful of milk and meal to drink, she took Alice
and Beatrice to see the hens and the chickens
and the ducks. There were such a number of
chickens; and two hens had each a large brood
of young chickens. The pond was full of ducks;
and Ellen told the little girls that though there
were plenty of rats about in the farmyard, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>rats are very fond of eating young chickens and
ducklings, they never lost any of theirs, for they
had two cats that always slept and lived in the
hen-house, and the hens were so fond of the
cats that sometimes they laid their eggs in the
cats’ basket. The cats liked the chickens and
little ducks, and never let a rat come near them
in the night.</p>

<p class='c014'>The children begged to see the two good cats,
but Ellen said, ‘We will now go to the orchard.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The orchard was a little way off, up the side
of one of the hills, and the sun always shone on
the trees, for the hill lay to the south, and was
warm and sheltered from all cold winds.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What lots of apples!’ cried the two children;
‘the trees are quite full; and why are so
many on the ground and in a great heap?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Those are for cider, and are to be taken to
our cider press; but will you not have some
apples to eat?’ said Ellen, ‘I will show you
where some very nice eating apples grow, and I
will shake the tree for you.’</p>

<p class='c014'>They walked farther into the orchard, always
going higher and higher up the hill side, and
they called out every time when they passed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>tree which they thought looked fuller of apples
than the others, till they came to a tree which
was covered with red apples. This tree Ellen
began to shake, and the apples came down in
such numbers, and so quickly, that Alice and
Beatrice were afraid that the apples would fall
on their heads.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Will you not pick some,’ said Ellen, ‘and
put them in your baskets, and then you can eat
what you like?’</p>

<p class='c014'>Then they went higher still, to the furthest
end of the orchard; and there they had a fine
view of the sea and all the hills about them, and
of the town; and when they had rested up there
a little time, and eaten some of their nice apples,
they returned with Ellen to the farm-house.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here they found that a great quantity of
apples had been brought, and had been put into
a large trough at the back of the house, and a
horse was harnessed to a long beam of wood,
and the horse went round and round. Ellen
showed the two children how the apples slipped
down into a large hole, and were crushed inside
in a sort of mill; and she let them see how the
apples came out of this mill down below; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>they did not look like apples, but were brown
and soft, and did not look at all nice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Why do they make those nice apples into
that nasty mess?’ said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘To make cider,’ said Ellen. ‘The apples are
crushed to pieces in the mill, and in a short time
that nasty muddy stuff will be nice clear cider.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Cider!’ cried Alice; ‘how can such horrid
stuff ever be cider?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘We let them stand a short time till the juice
separates from the thick part, and it ferments,
and the juice becomes cider.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The cider press did not interest the children
long; they liked most to go about the farmyard,
and help to feed the chickens, and go to
the pond and look at the snow-white ducks
swimming about in the pond; and whilst they
were looking at the ducks putting their heads
down deep in the water, Beatrice heard a great
grunting behind her, and turned round and
called out, ‘Alice! look, what a big pig!’</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice turned, and saw a very large black pig,
with a great many little pigs running after it, all
grunting together.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How many little pigs are there?’ said Alice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>counting them as she spoke. ‘There are ten
little pigs; and is that their mother, Ellen?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, Miss Alice; and she is a very good
mother to her little ones.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice laughed at the idea that
the old black sow, who was grunting about in
the farmyard, should be called a good mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But she is a very good mother,’ said Ellen;
‘for she takes her little pigs into the corn-fields
after the harvest, and when she finds some corn
on the ground, she calls her little pigs together,
and lets them eat it up, and does not eat any
herself till she thinks that they have had
enough.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I did not think,’ said Alice, ‘that pigs loved
their little ones.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Indeed they do, and all animals love their
young; and if any one tried to take away one
of her ten pigs, the old sow would fly at them,
and try to bite them.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But will she bite us?’ asked Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Oh no; she is very good-tempered, and
knows that we will not meddle with her pigs or
hurt them.’</p>

<p class='c014'>After the children had amused themselves in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>looking at everything, and at last helped Ellen
to feed the chickens, they went into the farm-house.
Mrs. Laurence had a jug of milk on
the table and some glasses, and a loaf of nice
brown bread which she told the children she
had made and baked herself, and a pat of butter
was on a plate, with the figure of a cow on it.
Mrs. Laurence gave the children each a glass
of milk, and Ellen cut them each a slice of
brown bread, and buttered it with the nice
butter; and Alice called out that it was a pity
that Ellen cut through the shape of the cow,
and spread it on her bread.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You have a piece of the cow on your bread,
Beatrice;’ and Beatrice laughed, and thought
it very funny.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice thanked Mrs. Laurence
and Ellen for the nice bread and butter and
milk; for they were very hungry, and it was
their tea-time.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Laurence gave the children a piece of
white honey-comb on a plate, for their grandmamma.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Grandmamma has some from her own bees,’
said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>‘I know she has; but my honey has a different
taste, for my bees gather their honey from
Mutter’s Moor, where there is so much heath and
broom, and heath honey is reckoned the best.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I will ask grandmamma to give me some of
hers, for hers is very good. Her bees get their
honey from her garden flowers, grandmamma
says, and from the lime trees.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Mary put on their cloaks, and told them that
their grandmamma had sent two donkeys for
them to ride home on; for the farm was rather
a long way off their home.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice were very glad, because
they liked to ride very much, and besides they
began to feel tired.</p>

<p class='c014'>The little girls shook hands with, and bade
Mrs. Laurence and Ellen good-bye, and were
lifted on to their donkeys; and Mary walked
by the side of Beatrice’s donkey, and held her
donkey’s bridle, and thus they reached their
own pretty home on the hill, and found grandmamma
waiting for them at the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice told grandmamma about
everything they had seen and done, and were
soon glad to go to bed.</p>

‘WE have had such a nice walk, grandmamma!’
said Alice, entering the
room. ‘We went first with Mary
to the village, and she bought herself some
needles and pins, and some cotton; and then
we left those books, which you gave us, at the
rectory; and we saw Mr. Potter’s beautiful
garden, which goes up that steep hill by the
house. There were such a number of roses in
full blossom!</p>

<p class='c014'>‘We walked a little way into Branscombe
parish, and there was a big stone, and Mary
told us that it was there to show where
Salcombe and Branscombe met. It was so
funny for Beatrice and me to jump in and out
of Salcombe! How can people divide places?’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>‘Places or parishes or countries that cannot
be divided by water must be divided by landmarks.
These landmarks are sometimes large
stones, sometimes an old tree, or a line of
trees, or a wooden post; but water divides the
best.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I remember, when I was young, travelling
from Belgium into Prussia, and only a post
painted with each country’s colours served to
show us where Belgium ended and where
Prussia began; and my sisters and I thought
it fun to jump with one step from one country
into another, as you did to-day from one parish
into another.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Because England is an island, and is separated
by the sea from other countries, English
people think it strange that nothing more than
a stone or a post can serve as boundary between
two strange countries; and that the people on
the one side of the stone or post should speak
one language, and on the other should speak
another language. Some countries are divided
by a chain of mountains, as the Pyrenees divide
France from Spain; the Alps, France from
Italy. You have learnt about these chains of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>mountains, my Alice, and to-morrow you shall
show me on the map the different mountain
boundaries.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But we came home by the wood, grandmamma,’
said Beatrice, ‘and we saw such
pretty creatures jumping about in the trees.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Mary called them squirrels,’ said Alice.
‘They were so pretty, and jumped from one
tree to another such long jumps, and swung
backwards and forwards on such little branches
that we were afraid that they would fall
down.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Squirrels are very pretty, interesting little
animals,’ said grandmamma, ‘and live in the
woods; and I think that they like fir-trees
most, for I have seen them often in a fir wood,
and I know that they eat the seeds of the
spruce fir—you have seen the pretty long cones—and
the squirrel bites the cones asunder and
eats the seeds.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Did you observe how small and slender
they are, with small heads and pointed noses,
and such bright eyes? The colour of their
fur is reddish brown, and they have such a
long bushy tail. The squirrel makes two nests,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>a summer nest and a winter nest. In the
latter, which is very strongly built, and thick
and warm, it rolls itself up and lies asleep
through much of the winter time. The
squirrel’s summer nest, on the contrary, is
light and airy, and it is made near the end of
a bough, so that it swings about with the wind,
and rocks like “the cradle on the tree-top,”
and there the mother-squirrel has her little
ones: but if any one should try and climb the
tree, she takes her little ones, one by one, in
her mouth, and leaps from branch to branch
and from tree to tree, till she is sure they are
safe; but when the danger has passed, she
takes them back again to her nest in the same
manner.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How clever of the squirrel! I should like
to see a squirrel jumping with a little squirrel
in its mouth. May we go again to the wood?
perhaps we may see the pretty squirrels again.’</p>

ONE evening there was a great storm,
although it was not autumn yet,
which is the time for storms. The
wind had been very high all the morning, and
had become louder and more stormy as the
day went by; and just before the children were
going to bed, their grandmamma told them that
she was very anxious, for such a stormy night
would be, without doubt, dangerous to many
ships now at sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>The noise of the wind was very great, and
the doors and windows rattled and shook, and
Alice asked—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Is that loud noise the sea that we hear,
grandmamma?’ And her grandmamma told
her it was; and when they listened they heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the roar of the waves as they broke upon the
shore, and they thought that they even heard
the shingle rolling back with the heavy waves.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Do not forget to add to your prayers to-night,
“God bless all those at sea,” my dear
children; for there will be many who may stand
in great need of God’s merciful help to-night,’
said grandmamma, as Alice and Beatrice bade
her ‘good-night.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The two little girls went to bed, thinking
much of their grandmamma’s words, and did
not forget to pray for ‘all those at sea.’ The
noise of the storm at first kept them awake, but
sleep came soon, and they forgot in sleep all
their thoughts and fears.</p>

<p class='c014'>Before breakfast the next morning the news
was brought that a large ship had been thrown
on the shore at Sidmouth during the night, but
not a single life was lost.</p>

<p class='c014'>The news was brought by the gardener, who
had been in Sidmouth very early in the morning,
and therefore grandmamma sent for him
afterwards to come and tell her all he knew
about the wreck.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is not much of a wreck,’ the man said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>‘for the ship has not had much damage. It
was a special mercy of God that the moon had
risen soon after midnight, so it was light; and
the master of the ship knew the coast well, and
knew, too, that unless he kept the schooner
straight upon the town, it would go to bits on
either side of it against our rocks. And so, in
spite of the fury of the storm, he managed to
steer her hard on to the shore, which is deep
enough, you know, ma’am, at high water. The
south-west wind helped to drive her on; but
the men got frightened at last, and took to the
boat as soon as they could see the Sidmouth
lights, for they could not help fearing that the
ship would go aground and break up.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The crew, who rowed for their lives, had
not reached the shore when they saw their ship
come on past them with mighty force; and
with the high tide she ran high and dry on
to the parade, not far from the coastguard’s
station, where she is still.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is quite a wonder; and what a mercy
that not a soul has perished! for the crew were
soon thrown on the shore by the breakers; and
though, of course, they were wet to the skin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and worn out, yet they were all, thank God,
safe.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘A number of the fishermen, who had been
watching the ship some hours, and had waited
for them, ran down and caught the boat just
when a huge breaker had lifted it up, and would
have torn both men and boat away back into
the raging sea.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The children asked how the fishermen were
not afraid that those dreadful waves would carry
them away too.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The breakers would have done so, miss,’
said John; ‘but the men all held on to a stout
rope fixed to the shore, and were able to keep
their feet, holding by the boat at the same time,
when the big breaker went clean over them, and
thus it could not sweep them away.’</p>

<p class='c014'>When grandmamma heard this, she told Alice
and Beatrice that she should drive with them
to Sidmouth and see the ship, and learn more
about this wonderful coming on shore and
merciful escape.</p>

<p class='c014'>The two little girls were so glad, and talked
of nothing but the ship and what they should
see, as they drove over the hill to the town.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The carriage stopped at the hotel on the
parade, and from there grandmamma and Alice
and Beatrice walked till they came near the
stranded ship, which looked such a huge
monster out of the water.</p>

<p class='c014'>A great crowd had collected round the ship,
but they were allowed to pass and come much
nearer. The sailors were running backwards
and forwards, talking loud and telling everybody
what a night they had had, how terrible
the storm had been, and what they had done to
save their lives.</p>

<p class='c014'>A gentleman, a friend of grandmamma’s, told
her a great deal about the ship, and said that
it had come from the eastern coast of Africa,
round by the Cape of Good Hope, and that
the sailors had brought with them numberless
animals and curious articles, and they wished
to sell them here; for they must now go by
land to London, and could take but very little
with them. The gentleman pointed at the
same time to several small monkeys that were
climbing up the ropes and rigging of the ship,
and jumping about, and shrieking and chattering
to the people below. They seemed very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>happy at being loose, instead of shut up in
cages, and to enjoy being safe and quiet instead
of being tossed and thrown about upon those
terrible rough waves.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice were lost in wonder, and
were quite silent; they had never before seen
so much that was new and strange to them,
and here was so much to see.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly Alice called out, ‘Grandmamma,
do you see that beautiful bird? Pray look;
what bird is it?’</p>

<p class='c014'>And at the same time a sailor came up to
them with a very fine parrot in a small cage.
The parrot was grey and red, but its feathers
were ruffled and wet, and the cage was so small
that the poor parrot could hardly turn round.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Will you buy a beautiful talking parrot?’
said the sailor; ‘he can say anything you like.
Please, will you have it, ma’am? I will let
you have it very cheap,’ addressing the lady, as
he saw that the two little girls had turned to
her and were asking her to buy his bird.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma agreed, and bought the bird
for a small price, for the man told her that he
should be so glad to get rid of it, as well as of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>a pair of green paroquets which he would fetch
from the ship.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Grandmamma buys a parrot saved from the wreck.—<i>Page <a href='#Page_125'>125</a>.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The sailor then, putting the parrot in its cage
into Alice’s hand, disappeared among the crowd;
and before many minutes had passed, the children
saw the same sailor on the deck of the
ship, and saw him let himself down to the
ground by a rope, and soon come again towards
them holding a small cage or box. In this were
two much smaller birds, of slender shape, with
long tails, and of the most beautiful green colour.
Alice and Beatrice could scarcely express their
joy when grandmamma bought them as well,
saying, at the same time—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘These are love-birds, from Australia.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The sailor looked, and said, ‘Yes, that is
their name, and they came from Sydney; but
the parrot I got off the west coast of Africa.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Will you have a monkey too, ma’am? One
of our men has several.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, thank you,’ said the lady; ‘I have
enough now, and am not fond of monkeys. But
now we must go, dear children, first to Brown’s
shop, where I will get two proper cages for our
new birds, for the poor creatures cannot move
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>in these. Can you carry the parrot, Alice? is
it not too heavy for you?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, not at all,’ said Alice, a little proudly;
‘I like to carry our parrot. May I hold the
cage the whole way home?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, if you like, my dear;’ and they walked
on to the shop, where grandmamma soon found
a nice large cage for the parrot. It was of brass
wire all round, and from the top hung inside a
large wooden ring, in which grandmamma told
the children parrots like always to sit and swing.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What! like the squirrels on the trees, grandmamma?’
said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes; I suppose it reminds them of the swinging
branches of the trees in the country where
they lived and flew about.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But where is their country?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘In some part of Africa; in that hot country
there are plenty of those gay-coloured birds.
You know where Africa is on the map, and that
it is one of the great divisions of the world?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, I know that: Europe, Asia, Africa,
America, and Australia.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Quite right, my child. But though it is
cruel and wrong to shut birds up in cages, now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>that parrots have been brought away from their
far distant home, and because it is much too
cold for them to live and fly about in the woods
in England, we must try and make our parrot
and those pretty little love-birds as comfortable
and as happy as we can.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Another cage, a square one, was chosen for
the love-birds, and seed was bought as well, at
another shop, and then they drove home with
their new live toys.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma showed Alice how to strew
sand on the board at the bottom of each cage,
and where to put the seed and water for the
birds’ food; and when the cages were made
ready, grandmamma opened the doors of the
parrot’s new and old cages, and putting the two
cages quite close together, the children went a
little way off and watched the parrot. First he
looked at his new cage a short while with outstretched
neck, till he saw the seed and water,
when he suddenly hopped on to the open door,
and then into the large cage, and began feeding
and drinking eagerly at the seed and water, as
if he had been very long without food, as most
likely, during the storm, no one had had time to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>attend to him, and the birds had been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘If the ship had gone down our birds would
have been drowned, would they not, grandmamma?’
said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, dear Alice, they would; and, what
would have been sadder, the poor men too, if
God had not taken such care of them.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I am so glad,’ said Alice, turning to the bird,
‘that you were not drowned, you pretty parrot!’</p>

<p class='c014'>The other cage was then placed next to the
little box where the pair of love-birds were, and
though they were more shy than the parrot,
they made a rush into their house, and they
seemed quite as hungry, for they began to eat
immediately.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘We will leave the poor birds now alone a
little, and get ready for dinner; and I dare say
that my little girls will be nearly as glad of their
dinners as the poor shipwrecked birds are.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The children laughed, and said that they
were very hungry, and they hoped that their
new birds would soon feel happy in their nice
large cages.</p>

<p class='c014'>After dinner Alice and Beatrice went to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>their birds. The parrot was swinging in its
ring; but though they spoke to it, and called it
‘pretty Poll,’ it neither spoke, nor moved, nor
took notice of the children. They remained
standing next the cage, and watched the bird
long, and were very disappointed that this wonderful
talking parrot could not, or would not,
speak a word.</p>

<p class='c014'>The little green love-birds seemed frightened
when the little girls went near their cage, and
flew about and fluttered, till Alice and Beatrice
left them at their grandmamma’s wish.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next morning their first visit on going
downstairs was to the birds. The parrot was
swinging again on his ring, and the love-birds
fluttered about; but Alice observed that they
had eaten nearly all the seed, and that their
feathers were dry and smooth and clean, and
bright green, and the children said that they
had never seen such beautiful birds before.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma said to Alice, ‘This morning
you are late, and you must come to breakfast
first; but another morning try and be ready a
little earlier, and then you may give the birds
fresh seed and water and clean sand before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>breakfast. To-day Mary will show you how to
do so.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice ate her breakfast quicker than usual
this morning, for she was apt to be slow, and to
talk and to waste her time whilst dressing and
whilst eating.</p>

<p class='c014'>When both the little girls had finished their
breakfast grandmamma told them to call Mary
to feed the birds.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘May I take two bits of sugar, grandmamma?’
said Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You may, dear; but be careful, for parrots
bite sometimes; and you are a stranger to our
parrot, and he may not like you.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The parrot would not take any notice of the
children, but swung backwards and forwards in
his ring. Grandmamma told the children to
ask Mary to place the two cages in the verandah
where the sun was shining, for it was a fine
sunny day, and grandmamma said that all birds
except owls liked the sun.</p>

<p class='c014'>Soon after the cages had been put in the
verandah, and both the children were picking
up and arranging their playthings, with their
backs turned to the birds, they were suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>startled by hearing a loud ‘Good morning!’
called out close behind them. Alice and Beatrice
looked round to see who spoke so loud, when
‘Good morning!’ was repeated by the same
voice. Beatrice was a little frightened, till Alice
said, ‘It is the parrot!’</p>

<p class='c014'>They were so pleased. Beatrice ran to call
grandmamma to come and listen to their talking
parrot, and Alice went closer to the cage, but
not too close, for fear that she should frighten
the parrot. She answered the parrot, and said,
‘Good morning, pretty Poll!’ and the parrot
spoke again and again, and said, ‘Good morning,
pretty Bob!’ When grandmamma came,
Alice ran to her and told her, ‘Our parrot talks
so nicely. I am so glad. But his name is not
Poll, it is Bob; for when I said, “Pretty Poll,”
he answered, “Pretty Bob.”’  And the parrot
went on saying ‘Pretty Bob’ and ‘Good morning’
several times; and afterwards he began
whistling and coughing, and seemed to wish to
show the children all he could do and speak.</p>

<p class='c014'>Beatrice jumped with joy, she was so happy
that the parrot could talk, and it was a long
time before they liked to leave the verandah.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>After dinner they took some bits of biscuit
to their parrot, which he ate willingly from
their fingers; but grandmamma reminded them
to be careful still, ‘for it may bite you when
it snaps at its food.’ Beatrice drew back her
little hand, and was content to let Alice feed
the parrot alone.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice tried every morning to be quicker in
dressing herself, for she could now do everything
for herself, except fastening her little dress behind;
and when she was ready early, grandmamma
let her feed and attend to the birds;
but when she was late, Mary did it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice liked to do it best herself; for the birds
began to know her, and she was seldom late in
the morning now. And every morning she gave
the birds fresh seed in the little boxes, and clean
water in the glasses, and put some sand or fine
gravel on the board; and little Beatrice tried to
help her as far as she could.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
ONE Monday morning, Mrs. Dunne,
who had come down to fetch the
linen for washing, sent Mary into the
breakfast-room to ask if she might speak to the
young ladies; and as grandmamma allowed,
Alice and Beatrice went to speak to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Dunne had a small basket in her hand,
which she held out to little Beatrice, saying,
‘My little Bessie has sent you a kitten, miss;
for cook tells me that there is no cat in the
house, and I hope that you will take this.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Beatrice took the basket and lifted the lid,
and she and Alice saw such a pretty little
kitten lying curled up, half asleep. It was as
white as snow, and had a blue ribbon round its
neck. The kitten got up and stood in the
basket ready to jump out; but Beatrice in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>delight seized it, and was going to run away
with it, when Alice said—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Wait, Beatrice, let me take it; you will
frighten this dear little kitten.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But I want to show it to grandmamma,’ said
the little girl, turning back very unwillingly;
‘let me take it, please Alice.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You may, only do not squeeze it,’ said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Dunne put the kitten nicely into
Beatrice’s arms, and Beatrice stroked the kitten,
and the little creature began to purr and
to rub its nose against Beatrice’s hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Thank you, Mrs. Dunne,’ said Alice, ‘please
thank little Bessie, and tell her it is the prettiest
kitten in the world.’ And Beatrice said ‘Thank
you’ too, and then both children went back
to their grandmother to show her the kitten.
Grandmamma admired it very much, and told
Mary to bring some milk in a saucer for the
kitten, and she did so. The kitten seemed very
hungry, for it lapped the milk up in a very short
time.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I hope that pussy will not hurt the love-birds
or your parrot,’ said grandmamma; ‘for cats
like to eat birds.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>‘Pussy must not eat our birds,’ said Alice,
‘or else we will send her back again.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But can we not teach the kitten not to go
near the cages?’ said Beatrice. ‘The love-birds
hang too high for her, I think; and if she goes
to the parrot, he will peck Miss Pussy so hard
with his sharp beak that she will not go near
him again.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I am glad that we have a cat at last,’ said
grandmamma; ‘for there are several mice in
my storeroom, and yesterday I saw one in the
dining-room, eating some of the seed Bobby had
dropped on the carpet.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Mary says that there are mice in her pantry
too, and cook told Mrs. Dunne that we wanted a
cat very much in the house,’ said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Then it is a very good thing that we have
this cat,’ said Beatrice. ‘What name shall we
call the kitten, grandmamma?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘As I hope that she will catch all our mice,
shall we call her Mouser?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Oh yes, grandmamma. Mouser is such a
pretty name for her;’ and Beatrice ran to her
kitten, and called her ‘Mouser’ several times.</p>

<p class='c014'>The kitten was sent into the kitchen during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the children’s lessons; but as soon as these
were over, Alice and Beatrice asked leave to go
and fetch it, and after they had played with the
cat some time, grandmamma told them they
must go out for a walk.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice kissed their dear little
puss, and bade her good-bye, and went out with
Mary for their walk; and on their return, Mary
went to her dinner, and the little girls played
with Mouser up and down the gravel walk.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice, meanwhile, was running her hoop down
some of the sloping walks, and liked especially
to make her hoop hop down the stone steps of
each of the different terraces. Alice was able to
keep her hoop from falling, although she made
it jump down every step; and she was very
proud of doing this.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wolf, the great dog, was chasing round and
round the garden, now barking at some sparrows,
and now at Alice’s hoop; then Alice and Wolf
had a race together, and when they both came to
the gravel walk where Beatrice was playing with
her kitten, Wolf gave a growl, and was going up
to the cat, which was in Beatrice’s arms; but
Pussy was quicker than Wolf, for with one leap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>she sprang up a tree close by, and was in the
branches in a minute.</p>

<p class='c014'>Beatrice gave a cry of fear, for Wolf had
startled her by coming up so suddenly; and
then his attack on her dear little kitten made
her quite afraid, and, half crying, Beatrice began
to scold Wolf, and to call him a very naughty
dog.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice soon came up, and took hold of Wolf by
the collar, for he was barking and jumping up at
the tree where the kitten had taken shelter; but
Wolf would not attend to Alice; and Beatrice
was more frightened about her little cat, and
began to cry. Grandmamma had heard the
noise, and came running to help the children,
and was soon able to make Wolf leave the tree.
As soon as the dog was gone away, grandmamma
went to the tree, and lifted down the trembling
kitten, who seemed glad to take refuge in her
arms.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice had called Wolf away; and little
Beatrice followed grandmamma through the
open window into the house, and was very glad
to have her little Mouser safe indoors again.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘We must teach Wolf to be kind to pussy,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>said grandmamma to Beatrice, giving her the
kitten to take upstairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Please do, grandmamma,’ replied Beatrice,
ready to cry again; and she ran upstairs to take
off her things, and to tell Mary all that had
happened.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma went back to Alice, who was
standing quietly on the gravel walk with her
hoop in one hand and holding Wolf by the
collar with the other.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You are a brave little girl,’ said grandmamma,
‘and have kept Wolf in good order.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma then began to scold Wolf, and
to talk to him; and the big dog looked wistfully
into his mistress’s face, as if he understood
what she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But come in now, my Alice; it is late, and
dinner is waiting.’ And they went indoors.</p>

‘GRANDMAMMA, will you tell me,’
asked Alice one day, ‘how the geese
can know when bad weather is
coming? Ellen Laurence told me that they
knew.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘They certainly do know, I believe, my dear
Alice,’ replied her grandmamma. ‘God has
given animals the instinct to foresee changes of
weather.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But what is instinct?’ inquired Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Instinct is a knowledge that comes of itself.
It is a gift natural to animals, given, as I said
before, by God; and thus animals know when
storms and bad weather are coming, and when
an earthquake is about to take place. Even
dogs will try and give warning, when the house
they live in is in danger of falling; and it is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>well-known fact that rats will desert a leaky
ship, birds will not build their nests in a falling
tree or any other dangerous place. I could tell
you several stories of the instinct of animals.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Will you, then, tell us some stories about it,
dear grandmamma?’ said both the little girls.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma thought a little, and then began
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘There was an old woman, who lived all alone
in a very old cottage; she had a little dog, who
was very fond of her, and always slept at the
foot of her bed. One stormy evening in autumn
the old woman was washing her feet in a tub
close to the fire, before going to bed. The little
dog ran out of the house and ran in again; at
last he came up to the old woman, and barked
at her, and whined, and then ran out of the
house again. The old woman took no notice of
her dog, but continued washing her feet; but
the dog came in again, and looked uneasy and
restless, and barked, and at length he took hold
of the woman’s dress with his teeth, and tried
to pull her away. The old woman pushed him
away, and gave him a little slap on his head,
and told him to be quiet, and the dog ran out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>again on to the road howling and whining; but
he came back directly, and seemed quite furious,
for he seized the old woman by her clothes, and
pulled and tore, and looked so wild and strange,
that his mistress took her feet hastily out of the
water, put them into her slippers, and followed
her dog through the open cottage door on to the
road, to see what could be the matter. She had
hardly reached the road when a dreadful loud
noise made her turn round, and to her terror
she saw that the chimney of her old cottage had
fallen in and part of the roof; she looked through
the still open door, and saw that her chair and
tub had been crushed by the falling bricks and
mortar, and she knew that she herself had been
thus mercifully saved from being killed, thanks
to the fidelity and instinct of her little dog.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What a nice story, dear grandmamma!’
said Alice; ‘and how clever the dog was! But
will you tell us some more about the cleverness
of animals? Are other animals as clever as
dogs?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Yes, dear child, many instances are told of
the sagacity or cleverness of other animals;
but I think that dogs are the cleverest, for when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>people have been buried in the snow, dogs are
sent to find them out.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Pray tell us how, grandmamma,’ begged
Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘There are some very high hills or mountains
in other countries, much higher than our hills
here, which are nearly always covered with
snow, and so cold that the snow is seldom
melted. These mountains are called the Alps,
and divide France and Switzerland from Italy.
(You will remember, dear Alice, the chain of
mountains you looked at in your map this
morning.) Travellers who are obliged to cross
these high mountains often lose their way in
the deep snow, and at last get covered with
snow, and they would die, and indeed often do
die, in the snow and cold. On stormy and
snowy nights, when travellers are exposed to
greater danger, good men, monks, who live on
those mountains, go out with a number of clever
dogs in search of those people who may have
lost their way. These dogs, by dint of scratching
and smelling at the snow, are able to find
out where the poor traveller has fallen, and has
been buried by the snow. They bark whenever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>they find one, and the good monks come to their
help, and dig out the half-frozen traveller, who
otherwise must have died.’</p>

<p class='c014'>After listening attentively, Alice said—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How wonderful it is! I did not know that
dogs were so clever and so useful.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But are cats as clever?’ asked Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Cats are very knowing; but I do not think
they have done so many clever deeds as dogs;
and people think that cats do not love their
masters or mistresses so much as dogs do.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But how did little Mouser know how to
climb up the tree when Wolf came near her?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘That knowledge was natural to her; she
knew by instinct that a dog would hurt her, and
therefore sprang up the tree as high as possible
to be out of his reach.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Wild animals are often much more knowing
than those animals that live with us. A young
horse that has not been driven long will find
his way often much better in the dark than his
driver; but an old horse, who has been used
to obey the rein all his life, does not trouble
himself about the road he is going, and goes
wherever the rein guides him.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>‘How very odd that is!’ said Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I will tell you a little tale of one of my
horses in Russia. It was about the end of
April, I think, when the spring was beginning,
and the winter just over. The snow was gone,
and so was the ice on the rivers, except in some
snug ditches, where ice was still to be found.
You remember that I have told you that the
winter in Russia lasts nearly six months.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The grass was beginning to grow, the birds
beginning to sing and to build their nests; but
the roads were in a very bad state with soft
mud and deep pools of water. Well, one evening
about six o’clock, the bailiff’s wife came to
me, and told me that her brother-in-law, who
lived in the valley close to the sea-coast, was
very ill; and there were no doctors near, and I
was accustomed to go and visit the sick, and
give them medicine. So the woman begged me
to go with her that evening to see the sick
man.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I asked her how we could go with such
roads, and she said that if I would let her, she
could drive one of my horses in her own little
light cart, for no carriage would be safe.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>‘A good horse was soon put to the cart, and I
mounted the cart and let the woman drive me.
We had six good miles to drive—down hill at
first from very high ground (for I lived on a
cliff that overlooked the sea), and then through
a very wild forest and some wilder bush-land.
The light cart and my willing horse took us
safely there. I saw my patient and gave him
the medicines he required, and then we began
our drive home.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But the daylight had faded, and it was
nearly dark; we could not distinguish our road
from several others that went in many directions
across the wood. The bailiff’s wife was
frightened, and soon owned to me that she
could not see to drive. But I was not uneasy,
for I knew my horse; so I told her to leave the
reins quite loose, and to let the horse take us
home. She obeyed my order very unwillingly;
and the horse, feeling his head quite free, made
a sudden turn into the right road, for we were
already on a wrong one, and from that moment
we went safely on.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘We had to go through a small brook where
the water was rather deep; the horse chose the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>safest road through the water, where the banks
were the lowest; he took us over a rather
dangerous ditch, where the boards that had
served as a sort of bridge had been broken down
in the winter, and were partly supported by
some frozen earth and ice; and then, when we
reached the firmer, better road, leading up the
hill, my good horse trotted steadily till he
brought us safe to my own house door.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You may easily think that I ordered my
horse a good supper of oats.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Oh, grandmamma, why did you not bring
that nice horse here? We should have so liked
to have him here.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma smiled and said, ‘Dear Alice,
that is so long ago, he cannot be alive.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Tea is ready, ma’am,’ said Mary, opening the
door.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Tea!’ said Alice; ‘we have only just had
dinner. How quickly the afternoon has gone!
I do so like to listen to your stories, grandmamma;
and look, I have finished hemming
my tea-cloth. I thought before that it never
would be done.’</p>

THE autumn had come, and with it bad
weather; storms and rain had come
too; but Alice and Beatrice found
the days pass always happily.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were rarely prevented going out, at
least for a short time, every day; for the broad
terrace of the sunny garden was always dry;
and there they played with their favourite dog
and kitten, and ran up and down with them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wolf and Mouser had become good friends,
and played together. When Wolf pretended to
go to sleep, Mouser would creep up softly and
slyly to him, and, putting out a soft paw, would
lift one of the dog’s ears; whereupon Wolf
suddenly awoke, shaking his ears with a friendly
bark; then Mouser scampered away and hid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>behind a bush till Wolf passed, then she rushed
out and leaped upon the dog’s back, to Beatrice’s
great delight.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wolf seemed fond of the playful kitten, and
let her play with him, and even eat from the
same plate.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice still ran races with their
hoops up and down the broad gravel walk, down
the sloping paths, and round the garden, and up
again to the wide terrace.</p>

<p class='c014'>Grandmamma was either walking in the
garden or sitting at one of the windows overlooking
it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Indoors their pretty parrot was a never-failing
source of pleasure to both the children.</p>

<p class='c014'>The love-birds they did not care for much,
and left them to their grandmamma.</p>

<p class='c014'>The parrot now answered them when they
spoke, and repeated all that the children had
taught him. He imitated every sound he heard:
he barked like Wolf, he mewed like the cat, he
called ‘cuckoo’ like the clock; for in the dining-room
there was a pretty German clock carved
in black wood, where a little cuckoo came out
of a little door in the clock, and called ‘cuckoo’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>as many times as the hour. One day he startled
Beatrice by coughing like grandmamma, for she
could not find out for a long time who it was
that had coughed. Mary told her how frightened
she had been one morning, on going into
the dining-room, in the dark, to hear ‘Who is
there?’ whispered so low, but so like some one
speaking, that she was at first quite afraid.
Sometimes the parrot tried to whistle a tune,
which he had heard on board ship, no doubt,
and he really did it very well.</p>

<p class='c014'>The parrot liked the little girls to come and
talk to him, and was very tame to them. He
always greeted them when they came down to
breakfast with a loud ‘Good morning;’ and he
waited patiently for a piece of biscuit or sugar,
which Beatrice never forgot to give him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whilst Alice attended to his food and cleaned
out the cage, Beatrice opened the cage door,
and the parrot came out, and hopped outside,
and let Beatrice smooth down his pretty grey
feathers, and he put his beak against her hand,
but he never bit her little fingers.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Grandmamma,’ said Alice, ‘you told me
once that the days in Russia were so very long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>in summer and so very short in winter. How
much longer and shorter are they than our days
here?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The longest day here in England, which is
June the 21st, is reckoned to be sixteen hours
and thirty-four minutes long. Now, can you
reckon how much remains out of twenty-four
hours for the night?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Oh, grandmamma, that is very difficult.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Well, then, I will tell you, seven hours and
twenty-six minutes. Now in Russia, or I
should better say in that part of Russia where
I lived, the longest day was about nineteen
or twenty hours long; and as there is a long
twilight, which comes before the rising of the
sun, and follows its setting, there is scarcely
any darkness, and everybody can go to bed
without a candle.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘What is twilight, grandmamma?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Twilight is an uncertain second light, or a
light that is something between sunlight and
night.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The peasants, or poor people, who work in
the fields, rise with the sun in summer, and go
to bed with it; but as the night is too short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>to rest them enough after their many hours of
labour, they divide the day into three parts for
their work, making a long rest from eight till
ten for their breakfast, and from one to four or
five in the afternoon for their dinner, and then
work till quite late at night. They sleep generally
once in the day, which is very necessary
for them.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘One beautiful summer day, in the month of
June, I crossed the Gulf of Finland, from Helsingfors
to Revel, in a steamboat belonging to
the Crown, which was much slower than a common
passenger steamer, as all things belonging
to the Russian Crown are very ill managed.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Look at the map, my Alice, and you will see
that Helsingfors lies more to the north of
Revel; and thus the days there in summer are
longer still, and the days in winter shorter, for
the more north we go, the longer are the days
in summer and shorter in winter.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Helsingfors is a strange town, with narrow
arms of the sea running into it and partly round
it, so that the largest ships can come close to
the quay or landing-place and to the streets. It
is nothing but rock, not cliffs like ours here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>but immense rounded lumps of granite, piled
like monster stones one upon the other. No
grass—nothing, in short, but moss can grow in
the crevices; but the people are very industrious,
and they have brought earth in their little
boats, and have made gardens on the rocks,
and planted flowers and shrubs. The spring
is very late there, the winter very long; for the
autumn comes early, so that the summer is
very short. No corn can grow on that rocky
coast; but stunted fir-trees manage to spring
up in sheltered cracks and crevices, and force
their roots between the rocks.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Farther inland there is more earth and less
rock: but little corn is grown in this cold
country, and most of the corn for bread is
brought over the sea to Finland, and in exchange
the Finns sell salted fish and wood
from the forests in the interior of the country;
and splendid blocks and pillars of granite are
sent to St. Petersburg from Finland.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘You would be amused if you could see the
loaves of bread the Finns make during the
summer for the whole year. These loaves are
large flat rings, which are baked as hard as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>ships’ biscuit. They are strung on poles, and
in summer hang up outside the house in the
sun, and in winter across the ceiling in the
kitchen, and are used as they want them.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But how do the people eat this hard bread?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘These rings are broken into small pieces,
with a hammer, I believe, and are soaked in
the soup or milk that they have.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But I have forgotten that I was telling you
about my crossing the gulf. Well, we left Helsingfors
about six o’clock in the evening, and
instead of reaching Revel at ten, we did not
arrive there till between one and two in the
morning. All the passengers remained sitting
on deck the whole time; it was not dark any
part of the time, but there was a strange soft
light in the sky, which was delightful. As we
approached Revel, which looks beautiful from
the sea, and stands high, above a fine bay, the
sun rose, which made it still more beautiful.
There were but few passengers on board; and
when we had landed, they dispersed quickly to
their different homes near the harbour. I alone
had to cross the whole length of the little old
town to reach my home on the high hill or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>cliff which forms part of the town, and overlooks
the sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘A young Russian sailor shouldered my bag:
my box was left at the custom-house to be
examined, for no one beside the guard was
awake there; and, followed by this man, I
walked through the deserted silent streets,
where cats and jackdaws and pigeons were
enjoying their freedom undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It was a strange walk at that early hour of
the morning, and pleased me much. I could
not help thinking how little real care was taken
of the sleeping town—not that it seemed necessary,
spite of all the orders of its jealous, suspicious
Emperor; for, only when I reached the
square at the end of my long walk, I found two
sentinels pacing up and down in front of the
governor’s house, and they were the first and
only sign of that strict Russian care which the
Emperor thinks he enforces throughout his
large empire.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘How easily could any enemy have entered
the sleeping town! and any one could have
opened the unfastened doors and shutterless
windows of each silent house; but there is one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>comfort in that part of the country, robberies
and housebreaking are not known, and my doors
and windows were never fastened even in the
long dark nights.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But there are no robbers here?’ asked Alice,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘No, my dear child; in beautiful Devonshire,
at least in this part of it, we are as safe as in
the Baltic provinces, where Revel lies.’</p>

‘WHEN will Christmas come?’ asked
Alice one morning, instead of attending
to her sum.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Christmas will come very soon, Alice, but
you must think of your sum now,’ said grandmamma.
‘I cannot talk to you about anything
till your lessons are over.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Please, grandmamma, tell me first how many
weeks there are till Christmas?’ asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Attend to your sum, Alice,’ repeated her
grandmamma. But Alice instead of obeying
began to cry, and said—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I cannot do this sum, it is so difficult.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Bring your slate here;’ and Alice did so, and
grandmamma said, ‘What is difficult?—show
me.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>‘I do not know what nine times seven are?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Not know what nine times seven are?
Think a little, dear child; you know it well, because
you said your multiplication of nine to me
only yesterday. What is seven times nine?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Seven times nine are sixty-three; but I want
to know what nine times seven are?’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The same thing—sixty-three!’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘So it is;’ and Alice laughed, but soon began
to cry again; and when grandmamma asked her
what was the matter now, she only sobbed the
more, and could not speak at first. At last she
said with many a sob,’ I cannot learn this long
piece of poetry, and do these three sums, and
learn my spelling, in time to go out with you
this morning.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Why not, my little girl?’ said grandmamma,
gently. ‘I have never seen you shed a tear over
your lessons before.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Because—because—’ and Alice began to cry
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Crying will not help you, Alice; wipe away
those naughty tears and listen to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I know that you did not begin your lessons
when I told you, for you remained talking to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>your parrot, and lost some time. But if you
make haste and begin, and if you do not cry, you
will do them easily. Look at the clock; you
see that you have two hours, for I am not going
out till twelve; now try and waste no more time.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘But you must not try to do all at once, or
even to think of all at once; begin and do each
in its turn. Learn your piece of poetry first, and
think only of that; and when you know it, look
at the clock, but not before, and see how long
you have been, then take your two other sums,
and do them without looking off your slate.
Your spelling will not take you long.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Try and do exactly as I tell you, and let no
tears fall on your book or slate.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice smiled, and giving grandmamma a kiss,
sat down with her book in hand, and in less than
half an hour she had learnt three verses of her
piece of poetry by heart. She then took her
slate, saying to herself, ‘I like to do sums, and
so does grandmamma,’ and one by one she did
them, then proved them right, all but one figure
in the last, it was always wrong. ‘I shall never
be ready,’ said the little girl again; but on
second thoughts she resolved to <i>try</i>, and in a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>minutes she found out her mistake, and now all
the sums were right.</p>

<p class='c014'>Her spelling was quite easy; she had only to
read the words over twice, and she knew them
all. And when she looked at the clock, Alice
saw that she had been but little more than one
hour; and taking her books and slate, she ran
full of joy to her grandmamma.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I am ready, grandmamma; I have finished
everything. I know my lessons; may I say
them to you now? I am so glad I did as you
told me.’</p>

<p class='c014'>‘I too am very glad, my dear child,’ said her
grandmamma, kissing her tenderly.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice then said her lessons extremely well,
and her sums were praised. Then her grandmamma
said, ‘You must never think of <i>how</i>
much you have to do, without remembering how
much time you have to do it in.’</p>

<p class='c014'>From this time little occurred to tell of; but
the little girls were very happy, and liked to stay
with their grandmamma in the country still,
although the storms of autumn had stripped the
trees of their leaves, and the winter was coming
on, and the garden had no flowers or fruit.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>The sun, however, still shone bright, and the
weather still was very mild; and they were able,
nearly daily, to take longer walks than in the
summer, and go much farther among the pretty
valleys and high hills of Devonshire, and they
learned to love their grandmamma’s pretty home
more and more.</p>

<p class='c014'>The two little girls looked forward to Christmas
with great delight, for it was to bring their
dear mamma to them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alice and Beatrice bid their little readers now
good-bye, wishing them as happy a Christmas
as they hope to have themselves.</p>

together with a suitable collection of Hymns; this completeness, obviating
as it does the necessity for using several books, will, it is hoped, be found
very convenient in these days, when the celebration of the Holy Communion

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
